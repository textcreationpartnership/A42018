            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Obſ.</hi> 1. Firſt, That a gracious heart is a jealous heart: <hi>Let my heart be ſound in thy Statutes,</hi> I am jealous of my heart.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the heart is eſpecially to be look'd after, <hi>Let my heart,</hi> O let my heart, my eye is upon my heart.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:94121:6"/> 3. That it is the deſire of Saints and gracious ones, to have ſound hearts, <hi>O Let my heart be ſound in thy Statutes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. That an unſound heart will one time or other make a man aſhamed. Let my heart be ſound in thy Statutes, <hi>That I be not aſhamed.</hi> If the heart be unſound, it will appear, it will break out, It will be diſcovered and tend to your ſhame.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Firſt, a gracious heart is a jealous heart, ſaith <hi>David, O let my heart be ſound in thy Statutes;</hi> I have a jealouſie of my heart that 'tis not ſound, and I would not be deceived here, O let my heart be ſound. That a gracious heart is a jealous heart, you may ſee it in the 47. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 6. <hi>v. I call to remembrance my Song in the night, I commune with mine own heart, and my Spirit made diligent Search:</hi> I Commune with my heart, and I make ſearch, and diligent ſearch to ſee whether my heart be ſound or no; ſo in the 139 <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23.24. <hi>Search me O God, and know my heart, try me and know my Thoughts, and ſee if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlaſting.</hi> Truly, Lord, ſaith he, I am Jealous of my heart, I am afraid of my heart; I have been ſearching and trying of it, and I am afraid there is ſome way of wickedneſs in my heart, I am afraid it will deceive me and bring me to ſhame one day; why Lord do thou ſearch me, and try me, and know my thoughts, and ſee if there be any wicked way that I cannot find out, and Lord diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it to me, and if there be any evil in me, do not leave me to my own heart, but Lord, lead me in the way everlaſting; Thus the Church in the 3. <hi>Lam.</hi> 40, 41. <hi>Let us ſearch and try our wayes, and turn again to the Lord, let us lift up our hearts with
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:94121:6"/>our hands unto God in the heavens:</hi> O come, God is angry and hath corrected us ſeverely, our hearts have not been right with God, let us ſearch and try our wayes, and turn again to the Lord; we have gone aſide, and we were not aware of it, our hearts have deceived us; come, come, let us lift up our hearts to God, he hath not our hearts yet.</p>
            <p>Now this Jealouſie that a holy man hath of his heart, is a Godly jealouſie, not a wicked naughty jealouſie, but a Godly jealouſie; there is a Godly jealouſie over others, and over a mans ſelf, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.27.</p>
            <p>Qu. <hi>Now it may be ask'd of what is he jealous in his own heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>An.</hi> Firſt he is jealous, leaſt the change which he hopes is in his heart ſhould not be thorough: he is afraid 'tis not a thorough change; he remembers he hath heard in Scripture that one may be almoſt a Chriſtian, and yet not altogether a Chriſtian; as <hi>Felix</hi> ſaid, <hi>Thou haſt perſwaded me almoſt to become a Chriſtian;</hi> I, but he was not a Chriſtian: he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members and conſiders, <hi>Ephraim</hi> was a Cake half bak'd, not thorough bak'd: he conſiders the young man in the Goſpel was not far from the Kingdom of Heaven, but not in the Kingdom of Heaven: Now he is jealous of himſelf in regard of his change; there muſt be a change in a man that is Godly, a thorough change, an univerſal change; now he hath a Godly jealouſie of himſelf, leaſt he ſhould not be thoroughly changed.</p>
            <p>Secondly, he is jealous from what principle he now acts: act he doth, but he is jealous leaſt he doth not act from a right principle, whether he act from the Spirit of God within, from the Divine
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94121:7"/>nature within him; Or whether he do act from reaſon, from affection, from nature, from cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, what principle he acts by he is jealous of: he hath a Godly jealouſie leaſt his actions come not from a right principle; all men act, but few men conſider from what principle their actions come; why they have a ſoul within them, and an underſtanding within them, and they act as men; I, but a Godly man muſt act higher: They are partakers of the Divine nature, they have the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit put into them, they have faith put into them, they have a new heart and a new ſpirit, and they act from another principle than the world doth: Now a Godly Soul is jealous from what principal he acts.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, A gracious heart is jealous of its own graces, whether its graces be real and true graces, or feigned, imagined, or ſeeming graces, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining graces; a gracious heart is very jealous, very watchful, very tender and careful in this point, it knows that there are ſeeming graces, which are not ſaving; it knows that there is repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate Silver, as well as right and good Silver; it knows there is Braſs, and Lead, and Tin, as well as Gold, and therefore is very jealous leaſt it ſhould miſcarry, and Judge that true grace, which is not true grace; it's jealous of it ſelf, and very vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant and careful herein: O that my heart may be ſound, and that I may not miſtake, nor be turned off now with common grace, reſtraining grace, but that I may have juſtifying grace, ſaving grace, and ſanctifying grace.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, A gracious heart is jealous about its union with Chriſt: union with Chriſt there muſt
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94121:7"/>be, if ever any of you be ſav'd; Chriſt is the head, and the body muſt be united to the head, and every member in the body muſt have union with the head; <hi>he that is joyned to the Lord is one Spirit:</hi> now a gracious heart hath a Godly jealouſie about its union; am I united to Chriſt, or am I not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived? am I not miſtaken? Is it any more than a bare profeſſion? is it any more than a bare exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal profeſſional union? Is it an Intrinſecal union? an eſſential union? Is it a union made by the Spirit of Chriſt? hath Chriſt hold of me, and I hold of Chriſt by Faith? do I apprehend, as I am ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended?</p>
            <p>Fifthly, He is jealous of his apprehenſions, his apprehenſions about truths, about joys; he hath other apprehenſions than he had before, and yet he hath a Godly jealouſie about his apprehenſions, leaſt he ſhould not apprehend God aright, and Chriſt aright, and Scriptures aright, and Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes aright, and other truths aright: He is jealous of his joy, he hath ſometimes joy, inward joy; but he fears leaſt it ſhould be the fruit of nature, of fancy, of miſapprehending and of miſapplying things; leaſt his joys be no other than the joys of the Stony ground. So of his feelings and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences; he is jealous there, leaſt he do miſtake in them, build too much upon them, draw other concluſions from them than he ſhould: And evry Godly man and woman hath cauſe to be jealous here. There are ſo many errors which are ſo like truth, and ſuch falſe joys, that men have cauſe, I ſay to be very jealous.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, he hath jealouſie in reſpect of his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; a gracious ſoul is jealous leaſt his affections
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:94121:8"/>be miſplaced, leaſt his affections be inordinate, run the wrong way, and run out too much towards things below, and too little towards things above; he is jealous that they be not plac'd upon the right object: That his love is not where it ſhould be, his hatred where it ſhould be; Jealous leaſt they do not work according as they ought to work in reference to the objects they are plac'd upon; Is my love upon God? do I love him him with all my Soul, and with all my heart, and with all my might? Do I love him above all things in the world? Is my heart with him conſtantly, and continually? Is my hatred carried out againſt Sin? Do I hate ſin in my ſelf? Do I not wink at Sin in a Wife, a Child, a Brother, a Siſter, or a Relation? So for his fear, do not I fear creatures more than God? have not I more lively ſtirrings in my Soul, in regard of Thunder, and Lightning, and dangers, and evils, and death, than I have of the great God of Heaven and Earth? He is jealous of himſelf, of his affections that way; jealous leaſt he ſorrow for Sin becauſe of the evils and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs it brings him, not becauſe it is againſt God, darkens his Glory, is the breach of his Commands, and defiles the Soul: So for the manner of his affections, he is jealous leaſt they ſhould not be real and true, but hypocritical; for many pretend much love, and friendſhip, and kindneſs, and yet there's no reality; ſo many pretend much love to God, and no reality; pretend much ſorrow for Sin, and no reality; pretend fear of God, and no reality; thus is he jealous over his affections with a Godly jealouſie.</p>
            <pb n="9" facs="tcp:94121:8"/>
            <p> Seventhly, A gracious heart is jealous over its own ends, what its ends are, whether its ends are right or no, according to God or no, he ſees men have baſe ends, and by ends, and ſelfiſh ends, and particular intereſts, which carries them aſide and turns them out of the way; and he is jealous leaſt his heart ſhould have ſome wrong ends; Religion is the pretence, and Gods glory is the pretence of all men: O to honour God, and to countenance Religion; theſe two ends muſt countenance all the baſe practices in the world, both by Papiſts and others: now a Godly man is jealous of his ends, leaſt he have not propounded a right end; and ſo carry on things in order to that end.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, He is jealous leaſt he ſhould neglect any thing that may conduce to his ſpiritual and eternal good: he is very jealous in this, <hi>Paul</hi> in the 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. laſt, ſaith he, <hi>I keep under my body, and bring it into ſubjection, leaſt that by any means when I have preached to others, I my ſelf ſhould be a caſt away.</hi> Saith <hi>Paul,</hi> I dare not neglect the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under my body, and bringing it into ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the Doctrine I p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ch, leaſt that by any means when I have preached to others, I my ſelf ſhould be a caſt away: Now a gracious heart is as jealous as <hi>Paul, Paul</hi> was jealous, he durſt not neglect Faſting, and Abſtinence, and Prayer, and Mortification; thus a gracious heart is jealous leaſt he ſhould neglect any thing that might further his ſpiritual good, <hi>ſo run that you may obtain,</hi> be ſure to caſt off every weight, and the Sin that doth ſo eaſily beſet you; caſt off the world that doth ſo hinder, O run, and ſo run that you may obtain.</p>
            <pb n="10" facs="tcp:94121:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p> Ninthly, Laſtly, he is jealous leaſt his heart ſhould cary out his Tongue, and his hand, to ſuch expreſſions and actions that are not becoming his profeſſion; he is very jealous, O let my heart be ſound in thy Statutes; let my heart never carry me out to do any thing that may prejudice thy Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, nor to ſpeak any thing that may diſparage them; let me not Judge, Cenſure, and Condemn, let me not lift up my hand againſt any, let me not think, or ſpeak, or do any thing againſt thy Statutes.</p>
            <p>Qu. <hi>Now whence is it, that a gracious man's heart is ſuch a jealous heart?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Firſt, It is from his own heart, that his heart is ſo jealous, the de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eitfulneſs of a man's own heart is the ground, or the cauſe of the hearts jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie: when it's once ſanctifyed in any meaſure, it becomes jealous, becauſe this heart is ſo deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.9. <hi>The heart is deceitful above all things, and deſperately wicked, who can know it;</hi> well ſaith a gracious ſoul, I will be jealous therefore of my heart, 'tis deceitful, 'tis deſperately wicked, 'tis hard to know it. Why <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e heart is deceitful? there is deceitful luſts in it, deceitful principles in it, deceitful aims and ends in it, deceitful affections in it, deceitful apprehenſions in it, it is a bundle of deceit. What experience hath a Godly man of the deceitfulneſs of his own heart? how oft doth it run out when it is hearing, reading, praying, and meditating? Therefore a gracious Soul is jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous over its own heart: how oft doth the heart excuſe when it ſhould condemn? how oft doth it condemn when it ſhould excuſe? how oft doth it cry up a man to be good when he is naught? and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:94121:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>how oft doth it cry him down to be naught, when he is good: There is nothing almoſt but deceit in our hearts, and therefore a Godly man is jealous over his own heart.</p>
            <p>Secondly, A gracious heart is jealous of it ſelf, becauſe it ſees men and women may go very far, and yet miſcarry, come ſhort of Heaven, prove rotten and unſound, and be aſham'd at laſt; a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious heart ſees men may go a great way, the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latians</hi> went a great way, and <hi>Paul</hi> was afraid of them; what ſaith he, have ye ſuffered ſo many things in vain, you did run well, you began in the Spirit, what now will you end in the fleſh? what turn to another Goſpel? what now be juſtified by the Law? the young man comes very near to the Kingdom of Heaven: I but this heart was not ſound, he had a covetous heart, his heart was not enclin'd to the teſtimonies of God, but to cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonſneſs; the fooliſh Virgins, did they not go far, had they not got Lamps, had they not trim'd up their Lamps went they not forth to meet Chriſt, and came they not to the Gates and knock'd, and yet no entrance? they were Virgins in name, and not in nature; ſeeming Virgins, not real Virgins; <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> went a great way, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Goſpel, they profeſt Chriſt, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into a Church ſtate, they ſould, their Lands, and brought the greateſt part to the Apoſtles feet, and laid it down, and yet not ſound at the heart. The ſtony ground received the word with joy, yet falls away when temptation comes; now a gracious heart is jealous of it ſelf; may men go ſo far as to read, hear, pray, leave the world, and part with eſtate, and be joyned to a Church, and yet not be
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:94121:10"/>ſound at the heart? O Lord what ſhall I judge of my heart? O that my heart may be ſound in thy Statutes!</p>
            <p>Thirdly, They are ſo, becauſe Satan is ſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, Satan deceives ſo many; Satan can transform himſelf into an Angel of light, Satan can inject good thoughts, good deſires, good opinions, and the like: Did not Satan get into <hi>David</hi> himſelf, and make him to number the people? Did he not get into <hi>Peter,</hi> and make <hi>Peter</hi> ſet upon Chriſt himſelf; <hi>O Maſter ſpare thy ſelf, this ſhall not be unto thee;</hi> and it's ſaid, that <hi>many were turned aſide after Satan,</hi> 1 Tim. 5. now this makes them jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, leaſt Satan ſhould delude them, how hath Satan deluded many in our dayes, and they thought they had Enthuſiaſms, and Revelations from God and his Spirit, whereas they were deluded by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan: I have known ſome have been confident they have had revelations from God, and yet afterwards have been convinc'd that they were from Satan, and that they have been deluded.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Laſtly, a gracious heart is jealous of it ſelf, becauſe the right way, the way to life, to happineſs, to ſalvation is very narrow, very hard to find, and few do find it, therefore ſaith a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious heart, I may well be jealous whether I be right or no, whether I have not miſtaken, O there are many by wayes on this hand, and by wayes on that hand, and but one way, and a narrow way, and a hard way, and few find it; have I found it? <hi>Broad is the way that leads to deſtruction, and many there be that go in thereat;</hi> a broad way, a pleaſant way, a down hill way, and many there be go that way; but the way to life and ſalvation is a narrow
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:94121:10"/>way; yea ſo narrow, that if Chriſt had not ſaid it, we could not have believed it; as narrow as the eye of a Needle: <hi>"tis eaſier for a Camel to go through the eye of a Needle, than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of heaven:</hi> and 'tis as narrow to a poor man as to a rich man, 'tis a very narrow way, rich men are loaded with the world, and they cannot enter; and poor men are loaded with repinings, grudgings, and diſcontents, and they cannot enter: Thus you ſee that gracious hearts are jealous of themſelves, and wherein, and why.</p>
            <p>Qu. A queſtion may be propounded; <hi>You ſay they are jealous of themſelves: but is not this preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial to a man's peace and comfort and ſpiritual good, that he ſhould have a jealouſie of himſelf?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>An.</hi> For anſwer to this, I tould you it is not ſinful jealouſie, but a ſpiritual jealouſie; and there is no hurt in a Godly jealouſie.</p>
            <p>But further, Firſt, it is not prejudicial to him, but advantageous: That Soul that hath a Godly jealouſie over it ſelf, will be kept from a ſinful and careleſs ſecurity, men that are not jealous over themſelves are ſecure and careleſs: But that ſoul that is jealous, cannot be ſecure, cannot be careleſs; that perſon will have an eye upon his heart, and will be awake, and will look to his heart: What ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> in the 4 Prov. <hi>Above all keepings, keep thy heart;</hi> if you have not a Godly jealouſie, how will you keep your hearts; the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure man is aſleep, the negligent man is aſleep: therefore here ſhould be the greateſt jealouſie, and this helps to keep thy heart.</p>
            <p>Secondly, This will make you to do your duty towards God and man with more circumſpection,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:94121:11"/>and with more vigour and life, a drowſie, ſleepy man, can neither ſerve God nor ſerve man, but if a man be throughly awak'd, then he looks about him, and doth his buſineſs with more minding of it, and more intention; ſo the Godly Soul, that is a jealous heart, O it ſerves God with more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, it conſiders well, I am to do with God, and God looks for the heart, and he calls for the Spirit; and therefore I muſt give him my Spirit, I muſt not be drowſie, and ſleepy, and formal with God. And ſo for men, I muſt carry my ſelf ſo towards them, as I may have approbation of God.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It advantages you upon this account; that it will put you on to make out your jealouſies, and to bring you to certainties and reallities; hath a man a jealouſie, I am afraid my grace is not right, that my ends are not right? Now when a man is awake, and ſees his errour, he corrects it: when a man hath a Godly jealouſie and ſees that there is ſome ground of queſtioning, then he will make it out, and bring it to an iſſue; as when a man hath a crack'd title, ſaith he, I will go ask Counſel, he cannot ſleep nor be quiet till he be certified herein, if a man have a good Bargain, or a good Match offered, and he hath a jealouſie about them, he will labour to make things ſure; when you have a jealouſie your Children are not well, you will carry their ſtate to the Phyſician, that you may be out of doubt, and you will order things ſo that they may come to a healthineſs; ſo in the Soul, when there be jealouſies concerning your union with Chriſt, and intereſt in God and the like, it puts you on to cleer up things to your own Souls.</p>
            <pb n="15" facs="tcp:94121:11"/>
            <p> Fourthly, It is the way to prevent carnal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidences which men are apt unto, men and women are apt to have carnal confidence in themſelves, to truſt upon ſome arm of fleſh or other, to reſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this or that; but now where there are. Godly jealouſies of a mans ſelf, or of his heart, it will prevent carnal confidences, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.3. <hi>But we are the Circumciſion which worſhip God in the Spirit, and rejoyce in Chriſt, and have no confidence in the fleſh;</hi> why <hi>Paul</hi> had a holy jealouſie of his heart, and ſaith he, we are the Circumciſion which worſhip God in the Spirit; we look to our Spirits and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in Chriſt, and have no confidence in the fleſh. Thoſe have not this jealouſie over their hearts, will have confidence in the fleſh, they will reſt and ſettle upon ſomething, which they ſhould not.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, is a gracious heart, a jealous heart? then here you are informed what to think of thoſe that do commend their hearts, and ſay, they have good hearts, good meanings, good ſoul's, and all's well with them: This is a common practice in the world, a common ſickneſs among ignorant and carnal profeſſors; they have good hearts though they cannot ſpeak ſo well as others, nor do as they do, yet they have as good hearts as any of them all: well, haſt thou nothing to commend the goodneſs of thy heart but thy ſaying ſo, thy very ſaying ſo is a clear demonſtration that thy heart is not good; for if thou wert gracious, thou wouldeſt be more jealous of thy heart than any thing elſe in the world, knowing that the heart is deſperately wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; thou haſt a good heart, though thou haſt a narghty tongue, a naughty life. The tongue of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:94121:12"/>the righteous is choice Silver, but the heart of the wicked is little worth; a wicked man hath a wicked heart, and it's worth little, worth nothing at all.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Is a gracious heart a jealous heart? then let us learn not to be conceited of our own hearts, or to preſume with confidence in our hearts; people are too apt to do this; but what ſaith the Scripture, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.26. <hi>He that truſteth in his own heart is a Fool, but who ſo walketh wiſely, he ſhall be delivered,</hi> from that evil: A man that's wiſe, he is jealous over his own heart, and he ſhall be delivered from truſting in his own heart. The Scripture ſaith, <hi>Be not high minded, but fear,</hi> Rom. 11.20. <hi>Well, becauſe of unbelief they were broken off, and thou ſtandeſt by faith; be not high mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but fear.</hi> Haſt thou faith? and art thou not then deceived in thy faith? Is it true faith? yet be not high minded, but fear; don't conceit too well of thy ſelf, and think, well, the Jews are caſt out, and I that was a Gentile am taken in, well, be it ſo, yet be not high minded, but fear; Fear, be jealous over thy heart, be jealous over thy ſelf, be not confident; ſo in the 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.17. <hi>Paſs the time of your ſojourning here in fear;</hi> have a holy jealouſie over your ſelves, be not too confident, be not preſumptuous, do not conce it ſuch and ſuch things of your ſelves, but paſs the time of your ſojurn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing here in fear. I ſhall come now unto the next point. Let my heart be ſound <hi>in thy Statutes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Obſ.</hi> Obſerve hence, that, the chief care of a good man, or a gracious man, is about his heart; O let my heart, let my ſoul be ſound in thy Statutes. A good man hath a care of his <hi>eye,</hi> a care of his <hi>ear,</hi> a
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:94121:12"/>care of his <hi>lips,</hi> and care of his <hi>hands,</hi> a care of his <hi>feet,</hi> a care of his <hi>family,</hi> a care of his <hi>eſtate,</hi> a care of his <hi>name;</hi> I but his chief care is about his heart: Let my heart, my ſoul, let that be right, whatſoever becomes of all the reſt; ſo in the 36. v. <hi>Incline my heart unto thy teſtimonies:</hi> and in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 41.4. <hi>I ſaid, Lord be merciful unto me, he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l my Soul, for I have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt thee.</hi> O my ſoul, Lord heal my ſoul, he prays for his ſoul. So in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>Create in me a clean heart O God, and renew in me a right Spirit;</hi> his heart, his ſpirit, that's the thing he principally looks at, and hath chiefly a care of, ſo that a Godly man his chiefeſt care is about his heart, about his ſoul, about his ſpirit.</p>
            <p>But what's the reaſon that a good man, his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal care is concerning his heart and ſoul? There be many reaſons for it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, becauſe the heart, the ſpirit, the ſoul of a man is the work of God, and committed unto his keeping by God: In <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. it's ſaid, <hi>God is the Father of Spirits.</hi> The body is from your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, but the ſoul is from God, and God commits your ſouls, your hearts to your keeping: keep, ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> that good thing which is committed to thee; it's true of the ſpirit or ſoul, which is created of God and committed by him unto your keeping: Now ſaith a gracious man or woman I muſt be faithful, God hath created this heart, my ſoul is Gods creature, and God hath committed it unto me, and ſhall I be unfaithful, and not keep what God hath committed to me? The Child that's committed to the Nurſe, ſhe will have a ſpecial care of it, why? it's committed to her truſt: ſo your ſouls and your ſpirits are the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:94121:13"/>Lords, and are committed to your truſt, and ſaith a gracious ſoul, I muſt have a ſpecial care of it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The heart, ſpirit, and ſoul of a man is very precious; of great worth; a man values his hand at a great rate, he would not part with his hand for a great deal of money; A man values his ear, his eye, and every Limb of his body at a great rate, but he values his life above them all; he will part with an hand, an eye, an ear, a leg for his life; I, but a man will let go his life, rather than looſe his ſoul; the Martyrs did ſo, they would part with their lives to ſave their ſouls; and that ſhews of what value, and how precious the ſoul is, <hi>Math.</hi> 16.26. <hi>What is a man profited if ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall gain the whole world and looſe his own ſoul, or what ſhall a man give in exchange for his ſoul?</hi> What is a man profited if he get all the world? there's riches enough in the world, but what if I had it all and loſe my ſoul? What's all this in recompence of a mans ſoul? No, it's nothing to his ſoul; ſo that the ſoul is of great price and worth, and a Godly man knows how to prize his ſoul; your principal care is over things that are precious, if you have a Jewel in the houſe, or any old Gold, or any thing given you by a Friend of value, you prize it at a great rate, and will have a ſpecial care of that, whatever you have of other things. The ſoul is precious, and therefore a Godly mans chief care is about that.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, A Godly man's principal care is about his heart and ſoul, becauſe that is the Treaſury or Magazine of all his ſpiritual wealth and riches; for where your wealth and riches are layd up, you will be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>re to have a care of that place: Now the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:94121:13"/>ſoul I ſay, is the Treaſury and Magazine of all your ſpiritual Riches: in this 119. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 11. <hi>Thy word have I bid in my heart:</hi> the Word of God is very precious, more than thouſands of Gold and Silver; now, <hi>Thy word</hi> have I hid in my heart; that's the treaſury of God's word: and in <hi>Jer.</hi> and ſo in the 8. <hi>Heb. I will write my Law in their heart<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, that's the treaſury: <hi>Chriſt alſo is ſaid to dwell in the heart by Faith,</hi> Eph. 3.17. There's a treaſure, there's riches; Chriſt with his fulneſs, Chriſt with his graces dwells in the heart, Chriſt with his Merits, Chriſt with his righteouſneſs and excellencies is there: yea, <hi>God himſelf</hi> dwells in the heart, in the 57. of <hi>Iſa. I dwell in the high and ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y place, with him alſo that is of a contrite and humble Spirit,</hi> &amp;c. I dwell ſaith God in the heart, in the ſpirit of a broken and a contrite one: So that the heart is the Store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, the Magazine where all ſpiritual wealth is; where God is, where Chriſt is, where Grace is, where Joy and Gladneſs is, where peace that paſſes underſtanding is; Now a Godly man hath a ſpecial care of his heart, becauſe there's ſpecial riches, the riches of Heaven, the riches of the Goſpel,</p>
            <p>Fourthly, He hath a ſpecial care of his heart, becauſe it is the Shop wherein all things are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd, hatch'd, and wrought, be they good or evil, ſaith Chriſt in <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. <hi>Out of the heart comes evil Thoughts, Luſts, Murders, and Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;</hi> In the heart are they form'd, fram'd, and wrought: Now a good man he hath Corruption and Grace in his heart, he hath Fleſh and Spirit in his heart, and the fleſh luſteth againſt the Spirit,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:94121:14"/>and the Spirit luſteth againſt the fleſh: ſo that he hath a ſpecial eye now, and care of his heart, to obſerve what workings are in his heart, whether the old <hi>Adam</hi> be at work, whether Corruption be at work, whether Grace be at work, whether the Spirit be at work, what workings are in his Soul, he looks unto that.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, His principal care is of his heart, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the heart is the ſeat of the affections; as it's ſaid of us, that in God we live, and move, and have our being; ſo in the heart, in the ſoul, our affections live and move and have their being. And the affections are nimble mercurial things, that do labour to get out, and if they get wings they will ſly, and fly far; now a Godly man hath a ſpecial eye, and ſpecial care of his heart, becauſe there are ſuch active things in it, as his affections: you know, in your Ships you will have a ſpecial care of the Powder Room; for if a ſpark of fire get in there, there's danger; ſo a Godly man he looks to his affections, leaſt they be fir'd and mount up, too high, or leaſt they be too low, too dull and flat; they are the pulſes of the ſoul, and they beat ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times too high, and ſometimes too low; they are the feet of the ſoul, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Take heed to thy foot, when thou goeſt to the houſe of God:</hi> i. e. affections they are the feet of the ſoul, and the wings of the ſoul, and a good man looks well to his feet, and to his wings, he looks well to his affections, becauſe they being in the ſoul, may exceedingly advantage, or exceedingly prejudice it: Therefore his eye is upon them.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, A Godly man hath a ſpecial care of his heart, becauſe of the many diſtempers and diſeaſes
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:94121:14"/>it is ſubject unto; becauſe of the many worms and weeds that are apt to grow and breed therein. The heart is ſubject to a thouſand diſtempers, a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand diſeaſes; o what ſtrange creatures breed there? what Vermin gender there? what weeds grow there? The heart of man is the Garden of God, and all ſorts of worms and weeds grow there: there will be deadneſs, dulneſs, unbelief, pride, paſſion, worldlineſs, filthineſs, revengefulneſs, and other diſtempers without number. A Godly man there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath a principal care of his heart, O my heart's dead, my heart's dull, my heart's out of frame, my heart's envious, my heart's malicious, my heart is revengeful, my heart is running after this or that; if you have one in your Family that's ſubject to the Megrim, to the Falling ſickneſs, to the Palſey, himſelf will be very careful, and others will be careful; why a man's heart is ſubject to all manner of diſtempers, and all manner of worms and vermin are ſubject to creep in there, all De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils in hell are ſeeking to get in there, therefore he hath a ſpecial care of his heart.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, The heart of man is in eminent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of being ſtolen from him, of being loſt, and therefore a Godly man looks well to his heart; he would not have it ſtolen from him, he would not loſe it, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.11. Whordome, Wine, and new Wine had ſtolen away their hearts; and in <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.26. what will it profit a man to win the whole world, and loſe his ſoul? he is in danger of loſing it; the creatures are ſly things, and would ſteal away thy heart, ſteal it from God's ſervice, ſteal it from doing its duty, draw it aſide from God: do not you find it when you are reading, praying, hearing
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:94121:15"/>or converſing of good things, how ſoon your heart is ſtolen away, and drawn aſide; therefore a Godly man hath ſpecial care of his heart: In 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. he ſhews you there the danger of riches; they that will be rich, fall into temptations and a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nare, and into many fooliſh and hurtful luſts, which drown men in diſtruction and perdition; they drown their ſouls, and loſe their hearts, they are drown'd and loſt in the creature, if they look not the better to it: Therefore <hi>Job</hi> had a ſpecial watch upon his heart, <hi>Ch.</hi> 31.7. <hi>If my ſtep hath turned out of the way, and mine heart walked after mine eye.</hi> Uſually the heart lets out it ſelf at the eye; there are three windows that the heart goes out at, out at the eye, —out at the mouth, — out at the act ons; your hearts will follow your eyes, your hearts will get out by your words, or your hearts will get out by your actions: Now a Godly man hath a ſpecial care of his heart, leaſt his heart be gone by the eye, be gone by the mouth, be gone by the actions; therefore he looks well to his heart, and looks well to theſe windows.</p>
            <p>Eightly, A Godly man hath ſpecial care of his heart, becauſe he knows where the heart goes, the whole man goes; if the heart goes, the hand goes, the foot goes, the tongue goes, all the whole man goes: for the heart is the Maſter, and all the members are the Servants; in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. v. 1. <hi>My heart is inditing a good matter, I ſpeak of the things which I have made touching the King: my tongue is the pen of a ready writer;</hi> the tongue will follow the heart preſently, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116. <hi>I believed, therefore I ſpake:</hi> when the heart is inditing, then the tongue will follow, ſo that if the heart go any
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:94121:15"/>way, the foot, the hand, the tongue, the eye, the whole man follows after: well, ſaith a Godly man, I had need look to my heart; for which way that goes, all goes; the whole man goes, and his Eſtate will go that way, and his Name that way, and his Relations that way, and his Friends ſhall go that way if poſſibly he can draw them: ſo that a Godly man looks to his heart; for that's the great wheel ſets all on work.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, He hath a ſpecial care of his heart, becauſe he knows God accepts not of any thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the heart be in it; therefore he will look to his heart, and have a care of his heart; in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29. v. 30. ſaith the Lord there, <hi>For as much as this people draw near me with their mouth, and with their lips do honour me, but they have removed their heart far from me, and their fear toward me is taught by the precepts of men:</hi> I care not ſaith God for all their worſhip and ſacrifices, or any thing they do, for their heart is not in it; there's no heart in their ſervice, nor in their ſacrifices, nor in their actions, nor in any thing they do for me: <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.26. <hi>My Son give me thy heart;</hi> 'tis not give me thy eye, or thy lip, or thy tongue; but my Son give me thy heart: He knew if he had the heart, he ſhould have all the reſt; but if he had not that, he ſhould have none of the reſt: 'tis the heart, the ſoul, the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that God's eye is upon, and that he muſt have, or elſe he will not accept of any thing.</p>
            <p>Tenthly, Laſtly, a good man looks to his heart, and that in a ſpecial manner, becauſe he knows that his heart, and ſpirit, and ſoul muſt return to God from whence it came, and be diſpoſed of by God to all eternity; <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12.7. <hi>The ſpirit returns to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:94121:16"/>God that gave it;</hi> he ſpeaks of man dying, and then ſaith he, the ſpirit returns to God that gave it: well, when a man is aged and comes to dye, duſt returns to duſt, but his ſpirit returns to God that gave it: Now ſaith a Godly man, this ſpirit was given me from God to keep, and it muſt return now to God to be judged, and God will ſearch it to the quick, and God will judge of it according as he finds it, and diſpoſe of it now eternally in Heaven or in Hell; therefore ſaith a Godly man, I had need look to my heart, look to my ſpirit, look to my ſoul, for as my ſoul ſhall be diſpoſed of, ſo will my body be at the day of judgment; after Death comes Judgment; the body muſt be raiſed and united to the ſoul, and where the Spirit hath gone, to Heaven or Hell, the body muſt go thither: therefore ſaith a good man, I will have a care of my heart, a care of my ſoul, that it may be well with me to all eternity.</p>

               <p>Firſt, this ſerves to reprove thoſe that are care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and negligent of their hearts and ſpirits, you ſhall have men to be careful of their houſes, careful of their Ships, careful of their Cloaths, careful of their Body, careful of their Beauty, careful of their Names, careful of their Relations; but are careleſs of their hearts and ſpirits: well, had'ſt thou grace, or wert thou ſo gracious as thou ſhouldeſt be; thy greateſt care would be of thy heart and of thy ſpirit; it may be ſaid of ſuch as of the Spouſe, <hi>my own Vinyard have I not kept:</hi> So theſe have not kept their Vinyards, have not kept their Hearts, have not kept their Souls, this is a great and a common evil, that men have care of this and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:94121:16"/>that, but not of their own hearts, not of their own ſouls; hath God committed ſouls to you? are they precious? and will you neglect them? the ſin be upon your own heads.</p>
               <p>Secondly, ſee here, that they are not many who are of this practice, to have a principal care of their hearts; where almoſt can you find a man or woman that makes it their principal care to look to their hearts? put but that queſtion to them, and they are ſilent, they are at a ſtand, what do you tell me of my heart and ſoul? I have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what elſe to look after; have you ſo? look after what you will you look after a ſhadow, and neglect the ſubſtance, you look after that which is of no moment, no weight; but you neglect that which is better than all the world: But I ſay, there's hardly a man or woman to be found in a great way, that makes it their principal buſineſs to look after their ſouls; ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi> in the 7. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> latter end, <hi>One man of a Thouſand have I found;</hi> not a woman at all, and but One man of a Thouſand; God made man upright, and he hath ſought out many inventions; God made man to look to his ſoul, and to have Communion with himſelf, and to mind heaven and heavenly things; But I have not found among women one, and but one man of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand: So may I ſay, it is very rare to find a man or woman that makes it their principal buſineſs to look after their ſouls, and yet that's one of the principaleſt errands you were ſent into the world about, that you ſhould mind your ſouls.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, you that think you do look to your hearts and ſouls, pray examine, and make a little inquiry, whither it be ſo with you or no, whether
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:94121:17"/>you do make this your work, your principal care &amp; buſineſs to mind your ſouls, to mind your hearts;</p>
               <p>Well, how ſhall we know it?</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, if you do look well to your hearts, you have a care what goes in, and what comes out; a man or woman that hath one choice Room in their houſe, they will be careful above all the reſt, to keep that lock'd; ſo if you have a care of your hearts according to what you ſhould, you will have a care what comes into the heart, and what goes out of the heart: a good man out of the good treaſury of his heart brings forth good things: he will not let evil things come into his heart; he will ſhut his eyes, ſhut his mouth, no corrupt words ſhall come out of his mouth; is it ſo now, that you have a conſtant care to ſee what goes into your hearts? you will be careful what goes into your mouths, and will you not be careful to ſee what goes into your hearts.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, if you have a care of your hearts, then your hearts are in good order; That which is principally look'd unto any where, is in good frame, in good order: if you have a principal care of a Watch, of a Room, of a Ship, it is in good order; what frames are your hearts in, are they in good order for God? are they in frame for his Ordinances? A Garden, if you take delight in it, if your care be there, how are things ordered therein? every thing is in its place; how are the weeds kept down? how are the vermin prevented? all is kept in good order: So it will be with your ſouls, if your care be there: <hi>I paſſed by the Vineyard of the Sluggard, and all was over grown with Nettles and Bryars; Prov.</hi> 24.31. why, he had not a care of his
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:94121:17"/>Vine yard; and ſo it is with the heart; but if your principal care were about your hearts, all would be in good order; they would be neat, comely, and delightful.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, if your principal care be about your hearts and ſouls, then you will make ſuitable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for them: That a man takes ſpecial care of, he will provide for, and make ſuitable proviſion: Now if your ſpecial care be for the good of your hearts and ſouls, you will make ſuitable proviſion for them, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. <hi>Make no proviſion for the fleſh to fulfil the luſts thereof<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>:</hi> But you will make provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for your ſouls to help the graces thereof, and the good of your ſouls; a gracious man will make ſuitable proviſion for a gracious heart: The world is not ſuitable proviſion, that's chaff to a gracious heart; a gracious ſoul cannot live upon the world, but it can live upon the Word and Promiſes, and the Ordinances, and the water of life: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaith Chriſt, labour not for the meat that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes; that is, comparatively, not abſolutely; but labour for the meat which indures to everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life, which the Son of man ſhall give unto you, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Well, here's the principal meat to be laboured for, the meat which indures to everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſife, which the Son of man ſhall give unto you: do you go to Chriſt in the morning for a Breakfaſt, at noon for a Dinner, at night for a Supper? This is an argument indeed that your principal care is for your ſouls; but O how lean ſouls have men and women, what hunger-ſtarv'd ſouls?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Fourthly, Laſtly, if your principal care be for your ſouls, then your ſouls are proſpering, thriving
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:94121:18"/>and fruitful: The piece of ground that the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man takes moſt content in, and is moſt delighted in, ſhall be well dreſt and fruitful; ſo that man or woman that takes moſt care for the ſoul, will have a thriving ſoul, a flouriſhing ſoul, a proſperous Soul. See it in the 3d. Ep. of <hi>John</hi> 2d. v. <hi>Beloved, I wiſh above all things that thou mayeſt proſper and be in health, even as thy ſoul proſpereth;</hi> he writes to <hi>Gaius,</hi> this <hi>Gains</hi> minded the things of his ſoul, he mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Truth, entertainment of Saints, was full of love, doing of good works, and his ſoul thriv'd and proſpered, and was fat and flouriſhing; ſo that man that doth mind his ſoul, will be fat and flouriſhing: The ſoul is God's Garden, and if you mind it, it will be as a watered Garden flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing; Chriſt will come into his Garden, and gather his ſpices and flowers, and eat his pleaſant fruits, and take delight in it if it be ſo; but are not your Gardens full of weeds? now if your principal care be for your Souls, you may know it by theſe things.</p>

The laſt uſe is an exhortation; that you would be pleaſed to beſtow a little more care up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your ſouls; a good man's care is upon his ſoul, ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi> in <hi>Prov.</hi> 4. <hi>Wiſdom is the principal thing, and above all gettings, get wiſdom;</hi> that's the principal thing to be got: but what's the principal thing to be kept? <hi>v.</hi> 24. <hi>keep thy heart with all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, for out of it are the Iſſues of life,</hi> and out of it are the iſſues of death: Therefore if you be good men, if you be wiſe men, if you be both, ſhew it, get wiſdom, and above all keepings, keep your hearts, keep your eye that it wanders not, keep your ear that no evil enter, keep your hand,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:94121:18"/>keep your foot, but above all keepings keep your hearts, for out of them are the iſſues of Death.</p>

                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 3. The third obſervation is this; that a gracious ſoul doth earneſtly deſire ſoundneſs of heart. Let my heart be ſound in thy Statutes; this was the deſire of <hi>David;</hi> ſo in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>Create in me a clean heart O God, and renew in me a right Spirit:</hi> O Lord ſaith he, let me have a clean heart, let me have a right ſpirit, let my heart be ſound in me, whatſoever elſe I miſs of.</p>
               <p>Two things I ſhall do at this time. Firſt ſhew you wherein this ſoundneſs of heart doth lye. Secondly, give you the reaſons, why a gracious heart doth deſire ſoundneſs of heart.</p>
               <p>Firſt, this ſoundneſs of heart doth lye in having ſound and good principles, ſound Tenets, ſound Doctrines, ſound apprehenſions of Spiritual things; and ſo here ſoundneſs is oppoſed to errour: Let my heart be ſound <hi>in thy Statutes,</hi> O let me not be lead away with any errour, any windy doctrine, any falſe opinions, any corrupt tenets, any falſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples: in 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.8. he ſpeaks there of men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith; men of <hi>corrupt</hi> minds are <hi>not ſound,</hi> they are repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate concerning the faith; that is, the Doctrine of faith, ſo in 2 <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. <hi>That the aged men be ſober, grave, temperate, ſound in the Faith;</hi> they muſt not be erronious, many men and women are full of error, full of corrupt opinions, full of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble doctrines, full of dangerous tenets, full of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction: now ſoundneſs of heart, ſoundneſs of mind, lyes in ſound principles, ſound apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of God, of Chriſt, of the Spirit, of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and of the great points of Religion, of the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:94121:19"/>Reſurrection, Juſtification, and Sanctification; many are unſound touching God, unſound in the things of God: They deny a Trinity of perſons, they deny Gods Omnipotency, they deny Gods Omnipreſence; theſe are unſound, they have not ſound hearts. So concerning Chriſt, how cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt are many concerning Chriſt? that he is meer Man, and not God, that Chriſt did not dye to ſatisfie for ſin, but to be an example; and many other opinions one might tell you of that are rife in theſe dayes, and people have drunk in; now theſe are unſound hearted men and women. — So con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Spirit of God, that it is a quality and not a perſon; — concerning Juſtification many untoward opinions are abroad, as that we are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by inhaerent righteouſneſs, and by works, that a juſtifyed man may be unjuſtified, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>—So con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Sanctification, that we are without ſin, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, that we can fulfil the Law, and do works without defect or defilement. —So for the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, they ſay the Reſurrection is paſt, that Bodies never riſe, and the Soul ſleeps; theſe are corrupt opinions, and men are not ſound hearted that hold them. When therefore we have right apprehenſions, and ſound principles within touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the things mentioned, herein lyes ſoundneſs of heart, let my heart be ſound in thy Statutes, let me have nothing but what is according to thy Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, according to thy word.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Soundneſs of heart lies in a healthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart, ſoul, and ſpirit; when a man hath any ſicklineſs or diſtempers in him, he is not ſound, we ſay he is a ſickly man, now ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart lies in healthineſs of heart, in healthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:94121:19"/>of ſoul and ſpirit; and ſo ſoundneſs is oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſicklineſs. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.6. <hi>From the ſole of the foot, even unto the head, there is no ſoundneſs in it, but wounds, and bruiſes, and putrifying ſores.</hi> You ſee hear; ſoundneſs is oppoſed to wounds, and bruiſes, and putrifyed ſores: A man that's ſound, hath no wounds nor bruiſes, nor putrified ſores; and here ſaith <hi>David</hi> in the 38 <hi>Pſal.</hi> v. 3. <hi>There is no ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in my fleſh,</hi> &amp;c. there were diſeaſes, diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and in the 41 <hi>Pſal.</hi> v. 4. <hi>I ſaid, Lord be merciful unto me, heal my ſoul, for I have ſinned againſt thee.</hi> Now when either guilt is upon the heart, or either luſt or paſſion predominate in the ſoul, the heart is not ſound. For the firſt, ſee the 33. <hi>Iſa.</hi> laſt, <hi>The Inhabitant ſhall not ſay I am ſick, the people that dwell therein ſhall be forgiven their Iniquity.</hi> Why they ſhall be forgiven their Iniquity, and then they are not ſick:—And ſo for diſtempers, or luſts, or any other ſin; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66.18. <hi>If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear my Prayer:</hi> why its the Prayer of an unſound heart; and in the 141 <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4. v. <hi>Incline not my heart to any evil thing:</hi> If there be any ſtrong inclination to any evil thing in the heart, that heart is not ſound, that's a luſt, and the heart is ſick; now ſaith <hi>David, Lord let not my heart be inclin'd to any evil thing:</hi> So that when a heart is purged from ſin, the guilt of ſin, the power and pollution of ſin, then the heart is ſound; for ſin is a ſickneſs in the ſoul, a diſeaſe in the ſoul, eſpecially when it riſes up to incline the heart to evil, now when it's purged from ſin, then it's ſound: when it's purged with the blood of Chriſt, and ſanctified by the Spirit of Chriſt, then a heart is ſound indeed, there's a
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:94121:20"/>heart ſound before God, ſound in the Statutes of God; that's a ſecond thing wherein ſoundneſs of heart doth lye.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Soundneſs of heart doth conſiſt and lye in the total carriage of the heart to God, and to his Statutes; when the heart is totally carried to the Lord and to his Statutes, and not to other things, and ſo ſoundneſs is oppoſed to divided<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; Let my heart be ſoond in thy Statutes, let it not be divided between thee, thy Statutes, and other things; the word here <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> doth note com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat and perfect; let my heart be perfect, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat, and totally in thy Statutes, and with thee; when a heart is divided, you know it is not a ſound heart; ſo when mens and women hearts are divided between God and the creature, between the Word of God and the things of the world, their hearts are not ſound, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 10.2. <hi>Their heart is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, now ſhall they be found faulty:</hi> their heart is not ſound ſaith God, their heart is not perfect, nor compleatly with me, their heart is not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried wholly to me; but their hearts are divided, and now ſhall they be found faulty: it's a fault in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and a foul fault, to have the heart divided between God and any other thing whatſoever; when the heart is not perfect with God. 1. <hi>K.</hi> 18.21. Elijah <hi>came unto all the people, and ſaid, how long halt ye between two opinions, if the Lord be God, follow him, and if</hi> Baal, <hi>then follow him; and the people anſwered him not a word;</hi> they were all guilty; why halt ye between two opinions? why is your heart divided? they were for God and for <hi>Baal</hi> too: it's ſaid, <hi>they feared the Lord, and ſerved Idols;</hi> Many are: for God and the world too; but why are ye
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:94121:20"/>divided? If the Lord be God follow him, and if the World be God, follow it; the heart muſt not be divided; if it be, it is not ſound: 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.21. <hi>ye cannot drink the Cup of the Lord, and the Cup of Devils;</hi> ye cannot be partakers of the Lords Table, and the Table of Devils; your hearts are not ſound, if you divide: ye cannot ſerve God and <hi>Mammon,</hi> ſaith Chriſt; becauſe there's a divided heart, and this is not a ſound heart. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 25.2. It's ſpoken of <hi>Antazia, he did that which was right in the ſight of the Lord, but not with a perfect heart:</hi> he did that which was right in the ſight of the Lord for the matter, but not with a perfect heart; his heart was divided, his heart was not perfect, his heart was not ſound; but now ſee what <hi>David</hi> ſaith this way, in the 119 <hi>Pſal.</hi> touching the ſoundneſs of his heart, <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>with my whole heart have I ſought thee:</hi> there was the whole heart, and the whole of the heart, there was no diviſion: here was a ſound heart, it was not divided, a piece here, and a piece there; half one way, and half another way; but with my whole heart have I ſought thee: and in the 69. <hi>v.</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I will keep thy precepts with my whole heart:</hi> here was a heart ſound in God's Statutes.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Soundneſs of heart doth lye in the truth and reallity of Grace in the heart: the heart is never ſound till it have true Grace; when there is truth of Grace, and truth of Comforts wrought by the Word and Spirit in the heart, then it's a ſound heart; there may be ſeeming Graces, and ſeeming Comforts; but theſe do not cauſe ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: Take Braſs, Tin, Cooper, let it be Silver'd over by the Art of man; this is not ſound, it is
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:94121:21"/>not Currant money; ſo many have parts, and they may have ſeeming graces, and ſeeming comforts, and yet not be real, not be true; ſuch a heart is not ſound: you read in Scripture of a <hi>feigned faith,</hi> a <hi>dead faith;</hi> you read likewiſe of feigned love, and there are feigned comforts, flaſhy comforts, and groundleſs hopes: Now where the heart is ſound, theſe are graces &amp; comforts wrought by the Word and Spirit; hence you read of <hi>faith unfeigned,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.5. and you read of <hi>Love, the fruit of the Spirit, Gal.</hi> 5.22. and ſo peace and joy: There's falſe peace, and falſe joy; but you read of theſe wrought by the Spirit, and love ſhed abroad in the heart by the Spirit; you read of a lively hope, of a hope that's grounded upon the promiſes, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Nevertheleſs we according to his promiſe look for new Heavens, and a new Earth:</hi> now when gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are real in the heart, and comforts are real in the heart, and there's a real truth in them; Then the heart is ſound. And ſo ſoundneſs is oppoſed to the fancies, conceits, and dreams of men, and their miſtakes; but their hearts are rotten not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all their dreams and fancies.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Soundneſs of heart doth lye in ſincerity; Let my heart be ſound in thy Statutes, let it be ſincere and upright; and ſo ſome read the words: And the word ſignifies <hi>upright,</hi> and <hi>ſincere,</hi> and ſo it's oppoſed to Hypocriſie: O let me not be an Hypocrite, let me not be a deceiver; a ſound heart is a ſincere heart; where there is Hypocriſie in men and women, there's an unſound heart, there's a rotten heart; the Apoſtle ſpeaks of love without diſſimulation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.9. So all muſt be without diſſimulation, where there is ſoundneſs; and here,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:94121:21"/>both the end, and the means, and the manner are reſpected.</p>
               <p>Firſt, where the heart is ſound, there will be ſound ends, ſincere ends; and among the reſt, there be three great ends; that a ſound heart aims at. Firſt, the Glory of God. Secondly, Publick good. Thirdly, the Spiritual and Eternal good of the Soul.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the Glory of God, that's the great end of a ſound heart; ſuch ends will a ſound heart have, as Gods Statutes doth propound, and hold out; now this is one great and high end that God holds out in his word, the glorifying of himſelf, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.4. <hi>God hath made all things for himſelf,</hi> for his own glory, for his own honour; God hath ſet up his own Glory, as his own end; and ſo a ſound heart hath that end that God hath propounded: So in the 11 <hi>Rom.</hi> laſt, ſaith the Apoſtle there, <hi>From him, and through him, and to him are all things, to whom be glory for ever:</hi> Glory is the end, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. <hi>Do all to the Glory of God; whether you eat, or drink, or whatever you do:</hi> that's the great end; 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. <hi>you are not your own, you are bought with a price, Glorifie God in Soul and Body:</hi> That's the great end of a ſound heart.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the end of a ſound heart is publick good; <hi>Do good to all, but eſpecially to the Houſhold of Faith;</hi> not a private and domeſtick end, but do good to all the world if poſſible, but eſpecially to <hi>Sion,</hi> to the Church of God, to the people of God; ſaith <hi>Heſter, if I periſh, I periſh; Sion</hi> is in danger, Gods people are in danger, I will not ſtand upon my ſelf, and my own ſafety, and upon the Kings Law, but Gods glory, the welfare and good of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:94121:22"/>
                  <hi>Sion</hi> lyes at the Stake, and I will venture; here was a ſound heart, that had a right end; if I periſh I periſh, I will venture my ſelf for God and for his cauſe and people.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It hath a right end in regard of it ſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> it's Spiritual and Eternal good: A Godly man will have a care of his body; but his great care is of his ſoul, and the ſpiritual and eternal good of his ſoul; <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.27. <hi>Labour not for the meat that periſheth, but for that which indureth to everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life;</hi> that meat that periſhes concerns the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; but there is meat ſaith Chriſt which indures to everlaſting life; and that's the meat you muſt look at; and that's the meat a ſound heart doth aim at, and ſeek to find out and to feed upon; <hi>Firſt ſeek the Kingdom of Heaven and the Righteouſneſs thereof;</hi> and ſaith the Apoſtle in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.18. our ſcope is not to look at the things that are ſeen, but at the things that are not ſeen, things that are eternal, and that concern the eternal good of our ſouls.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is ſincere likewiſe in regard of the means, a ſound heart will uſe all the means, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.6. <hi>Then ſhall I not be confounded, when I have reſpect to all thy Commands;</hi> there muſt be reſpect to all Gods Commands, to all his Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, to all his Promiſes, to all Examples, to all Invitations, to all Admonitions, to all Counſels, to the whole will of God; a ſound heart hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to all that God hath revealed, to all the means whatſoever; they have unſound and rotten hearts who throw off the Law or the Goſpel, who throw of all Ordinances, who throw off the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; but then ſhall I not be confounded when I have reſpect to all thy Commands.</p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:94121:22"/>
               <p> Thirdly, So likewiſe for the manner of uſing the means; many come and hear the word, but not with trembling, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.2. not as the word of God, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.13. they receive it not with love, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.13. they mingle it not with faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.2. they hear it not as the word that ſhall judge them, <hi>John</hi> 12.48. ſo many pray, but not ſpiritually, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.18. not feelingly and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.11. <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.16. not believingly, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.6. ſo many receive, but deſcern not the Lords Body, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.29. and many give, but not with ſimplicity, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.8. and ſecreſie, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.3. Now a ſound heart reſpects the manner in theſe and all other duties, as much as the duties themſelves, and is much humbled for failings in the manner of performing duties.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Laſtly, ſoundneſs of heart lyes in this; in the hearts putting forth to practice what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to it, or received by it: when a man hath truth, and witholds truth in unrighteouſneſs, that man is not ſound at the heart; but where the heart is ſound, the ſoundneſs of it carries him to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, what is revealed and given in unto it: you may ſee it in <hi>David,</hi> and in <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> 1 <hi>K.</hi> 15.15. David <hi>did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord, and turned not aſide from any thing that he commanded him all the dayes of his life:</hi> whatſoever God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him, that he did, his heart was ſound in his Statutes. And ſo here, in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38. <hi>v.</hi> 3. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member now, O Lord, I beſeech thee, how I have walked before thee in truth, and with a perfect heart, and have done that which was good in thy ſight,</hi> I have walked before thee with a perfect heart, a ſound heart, an upright heart, an undivided heart: And have done
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:94121:23"/>that which is good in thy ſight; that heart which is ſound, cannot ſit ſtill, cannot impriſon truth in unrighteouſneſs, cannot be negligent: Chriſt who had ſoundneſs of heart, went up and down doing good: So then you see wherein this ſoundneſs of heart lyes.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Why is a good man ſo earneſt for ſoundneſs of heart?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> Firſt, becauſe all he doth, be it never ſo much, comes to nothing if his heart be not ſound; ſaith a good man, I ſhall loſe all if my heart be not ſound. If my heart be not ſound and free from falſe principles, if my heart be not ſound, if it be not healthy and free from guilt and ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſin; if my heart be not free from divided<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, perfect with God, if my heart be not ſo and ſo, that I have ſoundneſs, if I be not ſincere but hypocritical and the like; all I do is nothing: Pray, Hear, Preach, give to the Poor, do what you will, all your ſervice falls to the ground, it never is accepted of God; in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>Without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God, for he that cometh unto God, muſt believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him;</hi> without faith 'tis impoſſible to pleaſe God: why, if your faith be not real faith, if it be not true faith, but a faith of your own making; if it be not a faith wrought by the word and ſpirit; a faith of the operation of God, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 2. you will never pleaſe God whatever you do, you muſt have a faith will purifie your hearts, and unite your hearts to God, and not ſuffer them to be divided; a faith that will carry you to God with the whole heart, otherwiſe you pleaſe not God: and ſo your
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:94121:23"/>
                  <hi>hope</hi> muſt be ſo, and your <hi>love</hi> muſt be ſo, they muſt be real; ſo alſo the obedience that pleaſes God, is the obedience of faith; <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. latter end; do what you will; if you be not right principled, if you have not truth of grace, if your hearts be not united to God, if you be not free from hypocriſie and ſincere, all falls to the ground, and is reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of God; all you do is nothing, but is like what <hi>Simon Magus</hi> did, Acts 8.13. <hi>Then</hi> Simon <hi>himſelf believed alſo: Mark,</hi> he had a faith, ſuch as moſt people have: <hi>And when he was baptiſed, he continued with</hi> Philip, <hi>and wondered, beholding the miracles and ſigns which were done:</hi> he continued with <hi>Philip,</hi> he was in a Church State, now ſee what he ſaith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his principles were not right, <hi>When</hi> Simon <hi>ſaw that through laying on of the Apoſtles hands, the holy Ghoſt was given, he offered them money; ſaying, give me alſo this power, that on whomſoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghoſt; but</hi> Peter <hi>ſaid unto him, thy money periſh with thee, becauſe thou haſt thought that the gift of God may be purchaſed with money:</hi> O thou haſt a wretched principle, thou haſt a rotten heart, it is not right in the ſight of God, what's thy believing now <hi>Simon?</hi> what's thy baptizing now? what's all thou haſt done? So ſay I, what's your faith, and your baptiſm, and your obedience, and ſerving of God, if your hearts are not right? <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira,</hi> ſell their eſtate, and bring it, and lay it down at the feet of the Apoſtles; I but their hearts were not right, and therefore you know how it went with them: all you do is but as a woman that brings forth a dead Child without a ſoul, which is not accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Father, Mother, or any preſent. 'Tis like
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:94121:24"/>Chaff without Corn, Bones without Marrow, Bottels without Wine, Breaſts without Milk: God regards not any thing you do, it is not accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, it falls to the ground, it comes to nothing if your hearts are not ſound and upright; and that's the firſt reaſon why a Godly ſoul is ſo earneſt to have its heart ſound.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Hereby you ſhall diſcourage and diſappoint the Devil, the Devil ſeldom prevails where there is ſoundneſs of heart: <hi>Job</hi> you know was a man that feared God, and eſchewed evil, a perfect man; The very word that is here in my Text, and could the Devil prevail with him? God lets looſe the Devil, and gives him more power over <hi>Job,</hi> than ever we read he had over any other man: and could the Devil prevail againſt <hi>Job?</hi> No, he was a ſound hearted man, and he could not prevail; <hi>Job</hi> wearied out the Devil, he did ſtrike him in his Servants, and Cattel, and Children, and in his body, and by his Friends, and by his Wife he tempts him, yet nothing could do; why here was a ſound hearted man, and when a man is ſound hearted, he will not ſtand parlying with the Devil, but he will reſiſt the Devil; he ſhuts the door preſently, and turns his back upon him; he brings forth the Shield of Faith, and quenches his fiery Darts; he brings forth the Scripture, It's <hi>written Satan,</hi> he reſiſts the Devil, and he flyes; but if thou be ſickly, or faint hearted, he will make thee flye or fall; but a ſound hearted man reſiſts the Devil, and makes him flye: and ſo the Devil is diſcouraged and diſappointed.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Becauſe ſuch a heart will be a ſupport to a man in any condition, in the worſt of conditions;
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:94121:24"/>if you look into the 14 <hi>Pro.</hi> 20. <hi>A ſound heart is the life of the fleſh:</hi> The Original is, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> the <hi>lives</hi> of the fleſh, a man that hath a ſound heart, ſound in a ſpiritual ſence, that ſoundneſs of his heart, is the lives of his fleſh; his fleſh may have many deaths, many diſeaſes, many temptations and diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, many hard things to encounter with, yet the ſoundneſs of the heart is the lives of the fleſh; a ſound heart will keep up a man; &amp; bear up his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, notwithſtanding the fleſh be full of pain, yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, drooping, and wearing away: ſaith <hi>Paul, the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man decays day by day;</hi> I but the inward man is renewed: when a man hath a ſound heart, a ſound ſoul, ſoundneſs of grace in him, the inward man is renewed: So in <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.14. <hi>The Spirit of a man will ſuſtain his infirmity,</hi> when his ſpirit is ſound; but if a mans ſpirit be not ſound, it will not ſuſtain his infirmity; if there be guilt, if there be ſin, luſt and ſickneſs in the ſoul, it will not ſupport; therefore a Godly man deſires ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart: he knows not what times he may meet with, he knows not what ſtorms he may meet with; a Godly man may meet with very ſhrow'd things in the world, but if his heart be ſound, it will bear him up; in the 38. of <hi>Iſa.</hi> ſaith <hi>Hezek.</hi> when the ſtorm came upon him, that he muſt dye and not live: here was the King of fears, the King of terrours; now ſaith he, <hi>Remember O Lord I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee, how I have walked before thee in truth, and with a perfect heart, and done that which is good in thy ſight;</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> with a heart full of peace, a perfect heart, with a ſound heart, ſee how this now bears him up.</p>

               <p> Fourthly, A Godly ſoul is deſirous of ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart, becauſe ſuch a one hath Gods favour, and will be intruſted by God; it's ſomething to have God's favour, ſomething to be truſted by God that knows hearts; a ſincere heart God fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, and God will truſt; in the 11 <hi>Pſa.</hi> 7. <hi>v. for the righteous Lord loveth righteouſneſs; his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance doth behold the upright:</hi> the upright, a man that's ſound, ſincere, and upright, and the upright dwells in his preſence; God he doth regard the righteous, he loves righteouſneſs, and who doth righteouſneſs but the ſound hearted man? And his countenance doth behold the upright, his favour is towards him, and God will truſt ſuch a man: call him forth to excellent ſervice, and employ him in great matters; in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. <hi>he choſe</hi> David <hi>alſo his Servant, and took him from the Sheepfold;</hi> why will God look to the Sheepfold, and mind a man tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Sheep? <hi>From following the Ews great with young, he brought him to feed</hi> Jacob <hi>his people, and</hi> Iſrael <hi>his inheritance; ſo he fed them according to the integrity of his heart;</hi> he had a ſound and entire heart, a heart for God, a heart for good, a heart for his people, and ſo God looks upon him; he takes him and brings him from the Sheepfold, to feed his people, and he did it according to the integrity of his heart, and guided them by the skilfulneſs of his hand. Gods favour was towards him, and God's favour is towards ſuch, and he doth intruſt them with great matters: 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.11.12. <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the glorious Goſpel of the bleſſed God, which was committed to my truſt;</hi> why, who are you, that you ſhould have the Goſpel, and the glorious Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of the bleſſed God committed to your truſt?
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:94121:25"/>
                  <hi>I thank God through Jeſus Chriſt, our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me worthy, putting me into the Miniſtery.</hi> O the Lord made me ſound hearted! when I had rotten principles, he took them all away, he made my heart ſound, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed me in great things; ſo that where there is ſoundneſs of heart, God favours and will truſt ſuch; when men have deceitful and hypocritical hearts, God will not truſt them.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Soundneſs of heart is earneſtly deſired by thoſe that are good, becauſe otherwiſe the means of grace, whatſoever they be, will do little good, very little or no good; look into <hi>Mich.</hi> 2.7. <hi>O thou that art named the houſe of</hi> Jacob, <hi>is the Spirit of the Lord ſtreightned? are theſe his doings? do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly?</hi> ſaith he, you complain of judgments and afflictions that are upon you; but I tell you your hearts are not right; do not my words do good to him that walks upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? if your hearts were ſound, upright, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, you would walk according to my Statutes, according to my wayes, and your hearts would be with me, and not with your Idols, nor with the world; therefore my words do you no good, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe your lives and hearts are corrupt; do not my words do good to them that walk uprightly? every one can tell you, they do; to a corrupt Stomach, you know the meat doth little or no good; it feeds a corrupt humour, and kills at laſt; So now when men and women have unſound hearts, the means doth them little good, the means will be their death at laſt: there was <hi>Judas,</hi> what gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious words did he hear from Chriſt? how many miracles and examples did he ſee? but all did him
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:94121:26"/>no good; why? he was not ſound at the heart, he had a covetous heart; and ſo <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> was not ſound at heart; the word doth men no good when they have unſound hearts, Sacraments do them no good, they eat and drink their own dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, afflictions doth them no good, Prayer doth them no good; therefore ſaith a Godly man, O Lord let my heart be ſound in thy Statutes.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Laſtly, ſoundneſs of heart is to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, becauſe without this you will never be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into Heaven, never be preſented by Chriſt unto the Father: In a word, you will never be ſav'd, unleſs your hearts be ſound; look into the 15. <hi>Pſal. Lord who ſhall abide in thy Tabernacle, who ſhall dwell in thy holy hill? he that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteouſneſs, and ſpeaketh the truth in his heart;</hi> that is, he that hath a ſound heart free from hypocriſie, a ſound heart, he ſhall do it; and in the 24 <hi>Pſal. who ſhall aſcend into the hill of the Lord? who ſhall ſtand in his holy place? he that hath clean hands, and a pure heart,</hi> &amp;c. Now if a mans heart be not ſound, 'tis impure; there is ſome guilt, ſome luſts, ſome diſtempers, ſome rotten and falſe tenets and opinions, ſome hypocriſie in it, ſome dividedneſs in it; there's ſome withholding of truth in unrighteouſneſs in it; now this man ſhall not aſcend into the holy hill, he ſhall not have the bleſſing; ſaith Chriſt in <hi>Math.</hi> 7.21. <hi>Not every one that ſaith unto me Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, but he that doth the will of my Father which is in Heaven; many will ſay unto me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecyed in thy name, and in thy name caſt out Devils, and in thy name done many wonderful works, and then will I profeſs unto them I never knew you; depart from
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:94121:26"/>me ye that work iniquity:</hi> What, do all theſe things and yet be workers of iniquity, and not known of Chriſt? there was nothing but rottenneſs of heart: for mark what follows in the Chapter, <hi>whoſoever heareth theſe ſayings of mine, and doth them, I will liken him to a wiſe man, which built his houſe upon a Rock, and the rain deſcended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that houſe and it fell not, for it was founded upon a Rock. And every one that heareth theſe ſayings of mine, and doth them not, he is one that builds his houſe upon the Sand:</hi> So that if mens hearts be not ſound, they will never build upon the Rock, they will never be ſav'd: Doth not Chriſt tell them plainly, woe to Scribes, Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, Hyppocrites? why they ſhall not enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Kingdom of Heaven, they are not ſound hearted; if men are not ſound in the things of God, ſound in the Goſpel and the myſteries of it, ſound in the faith, there's no coming to Heaven, no coming to Glory; Chriſt will never own a rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten hearted man or woman; never own a man that hath a form of Godlineſs, and not the power of it; therefore, if you would be ſav'd, if you would be preſented by Jeſus Chriſt unto the Father, you muſt labour to have a ſound heart. And here's the grounds and reaſons why a gracious heart looks after ſoundneſs.</p>
               <p>I come now in the next place to ſhew you the priviledge, dignity or excellency of a ſound heart; Let my heart be ſound in thy Statutes.</p>
               <p>Firſt, a ſound heart makes you like unto Chriſt, Chriſt had a ſound heart in him, <hi>John</hi> 14. The Devil comes and finds nothing of his in him; he found no erroneous principles in Chriſts heart, he
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:94121:27"/>found no dividedneſs in his heart between God and the creature; he found no ſicklineſs in his heart, or ſinful diſpoſitions, he found no ſeeming graces, but all real: the word dwelt among us, and was full of grace &amp; truth, he found that Chriſt was ſincere and upright, he had no baſe ends, Gods glory and publick good were his ends; now when a man hath a ſound heart, he is like unto Chriſt, a heart like Chriſts heart: this is an excellency, a priviledge, to have a ſound heart, that when the Devil comes he may find nothing of his in you.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the excellency of a ſound heart is, it's a heart fit for Gods uſe: a corrupt heart, a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided heart, an hypocritical heart, is not fit for Gods uſe: you know a man that hath ſound limbs is fit for mans uſe; and a man that hath a ſound heart is fit for Gods uſe; 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.21. <hi>If a man therefore purge himſelf from theſe, he ſhall be a veſſel unto honour, ſanctifyed and meet for the Maſters uſe, and prepared for every good work:</hi> if a man purge his heart from falſe principles, from all baſe luſts and corrupt diſtempers, if a man purge his heart from dividedneſs between God and the Creature (and the like) then he ſhall be a veſſel of honour, and a veſſel meet for his Maſters uſe; <hi>Flee youthful luſts; but follow Righteouſneſs, Faith, Charity, Peace,</hi> &amp;c. ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.22. when the heart is purged, cleanſed, and made ſound, it's a pure heart, and then it's fit for Gods uſe; and in Chap. 3. v. 8. It's ſaid of <hi>James</hi> and <hi>Jambres,</hi> that they were men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the Faith, they were not veſſels fit for Gods uſe: in the 1 <hi>Tit.</hi> laſt; <hi>They profeſs they know God, but in works they deny him;
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:94121:27"/>being abominable, and diſobedient, and unto every good work reprobate;</hi> when men profeſs they know God, but in works deny him, what are they? hypocrites, men that have but ſeeming grace, men that have ſick ſouls, and theſe are reprobate to every good work: there were in the Temple veſſels of Gold, veſſels of Silver, and veſſels of Braſs, &amp; theſe were ſound and ſit for ſervice, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.21. <hi>And all the Veſſels of the Miniſtry,</hi> if they were crack'd, if they were corrupt, they were not to be uſed in the Temple in the Lord's ſervice; if ruſty, if crack't, if corrupt any way they were to be lay'd aſide; but when they were Gold, and Silver, and Braſs, ſound and clean, then they were Veſſels of Miniſtry; ſo a man of a ſound heart, he is a Veſſel of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, a Veſſel fit for the Lords uſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, a ſound heart is a precious heart; a corrupt heart, a deceitful heart, is baſe, it's worth nothing, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.20. <hi>The tongue of the juſt is as choice Silver, the heart of the wicked is little worth;</hi> take a wicked man, and his heart is the principal part he hath; it's little worth, God doth not value or eſteem it at all; 'tis droſs, 'tis enmity to God, 'tis loathſome and abominable in the ſight of God; an unbelieving heart, a proud heart, a defiled heart, an hypocritical heart, a divided heart it's worth nothing; but the <hi>Tongue</hi> of the juſt is as choice Silver, what's his <hi>Heart</hi> then? that's like choice Gold; <hi>Prov.</hi> 12.26. <hi>The righteous is more excellent than his Neighbour;</hi> there's an excellency in a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous man, an excellency in his words, an excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in his tongue, an excellency in his heart: a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond that's crack'd is worth little or nothing, but if ſound it's worth much; ſo a ſound heart is of great eſteem with God.</p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:94121:28"/>
               <p> Fourthly, A ſound heart doth diſcriminate you, and difference you from all others; it differences you from all hearts that are erroneous, that are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, that are ſick, unſound, that are unhealthy, from all that are hypocritical, from all that are guilded over and have no ſubſtance in them: and ſoundneſs you know is a ſpecial thing; if the wine be corrupt, away with it, the Merchant cares not for it, people care not for drinking it; ſo ſound Corn, ſound Fruit, ſound meat &amp; drink at your Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, differences them from all others, ſo ſoundneſs in the heart doth difference a man or woman from all falſe hearted wretches, from all hypocrites, from all reprobates, from all that ſhall periſh.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, 'Tis that which God himſelf doth take pleaſure and delight in: In <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7. it's ſaid that the Lord made man upright, no crookedneſs, no unſoundneſs in him, no rottenneſs in him; and in the 1 <hi>Gen.</hi> laſt, the Lord looked upon all his works, and loe they were good, very good; God took delight and content in beholding of them; ſo man was made upright, and God took pleaſure in him; and when man recovers his rectitude and ſoundneſs of heart again, then God takes pleaſure and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in him; <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.20. <hi>Such as are upright in the way, are his delight:</hi> Thoſe that are ſincere, ſound at heart, and walk ſincerely and ſoundly in their Converſations are his delight: as if God had delight and pleaſure in nothing but a ſound heart; <hi>Enoch</hi> walked with God, and he was his delight; <hi>Noah,</hi> a perfect man and walk'd with God, he was his delight; <hi>Job,</hi> a perfect man, and he was Gods delight; dideſt thou ſee my Servant <hi>Job,</hi> ſaith God to the Devil: where there is a ſound and a perfect heart, that God delights in.</p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:94121:28"/>
               <p> Sixthly, The excellency of ſuch a heart is, that it's a ſtedfaſt heart, a heart unmoveable, unſhaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55.7. <hi>My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: David</hi> was a man after Gods own heart, he had a ſound heart, and his heart was fixed; nothing could ſhake, or move, or turn his heart another way, his heart was fixed, it was eſtabliſhed; a Godly man his heart is conſtant and perſeveres; <hi>Job,</hi> 17.9. <hi>The Righteous ſhall hold on his way;</hi> a righteous man is conſtant, he perſeveres, he holds on; why his heart is fixed, and nothing can remove the heart, and if they cannot remove the heart, they cannot remove the man; when the heart is faſt, the head will be faſt, the foot will he faſt, the whole man will ſtand faſt; <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.29. <hi>The way of the Lord is ſtrength to the upright;</hi> to the man that is ſound, the man that is perfect, the man that is compleat, to the man that is ſincere: <hi>Sound</hi> and <hi>upright,</hi> the very ſame Hebrew word is uſed for both, Now he grows ſtronger and ſtronger, ſo that here's his excellency, he is immoveable, he is fixed, he holds out to the end.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, The excellency of a ſound heart is, that it hath a bleſſedneſs intail'd unto it; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.2. <hi>Bleſſed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth not ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and in whoſe Spirit there is no guile;</hi> if a mans heart be unſound there's guile in it, there's Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie in it, there are rotten principles in it; but Bleſſed is the man in whoſe Spirit there is no guile; when a mans heart is purged from guile, his heart is ſound, and he hath a bleſſedneſs entail'd upon it; <hi>Nathaniel,</hi> a man without guile, and Chriſt looks upon him, and ſaith he is a bleſſed and happy man; you know <hi>Hypocriſie</hi> hath a woe,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:94121:29"/>
                  <hi>woe to Scribes, Phariſees, Hypocrites;</hi> but ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity hath the bleſſing, ſoundneſs hath the bleſſing; bleſſed is the man in whoſe ſpirit there is no guile, bleſſed is the man whoſe heart is pure and free from ſin, there is a bleſſedneſs entail'd upon it; and thus you ſee wherein the excellency of a ſound heart lyes. Now to come to the uſe and application of the point.</p>
               <p n="1">I. Is ſoundneſs of heart a thing very deſirable? then in the firſt place take heed of all things may make your hearts unſound: Men and Women will take heed of any thing, will corrupt their Garments, will corrupt their Stomachs, will cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt their Fleſh; you will not endure dirt in your Garments, why it will rot them; you will not endure poyſon in your broath, or wine, or meat, or bread, it will undo you: well, take heed of that then which may make your hearts unſound and rotten; take heed of carnal policy, take heed of errors that are abroad every where, erronious Doctrines and Opinions concerning God and Chriſt, and his natures, and death, and ſatisfaction; concerning the Scriptures, Ordinances, Sabbaths, take heed of theſe: An erroneous opinion may be the bane of your hearts, make it a ſick heart, and ſick unto death; if you can be careful for your Garments, for your meat and drink, for your Bodies, be careful for your Souls; <hi>Paul</hi> had a jealouſie for the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2. <hi>I am jealous over you with a Godly jealouſie,</hi> and v. 3. <hi>I fear leaſt by any means as the Serpent beguiled</hi> Eve <hi>through his ſubtlety, ſo your minds ſhould be corrupted from the ſimplicity that is in Chriſt;</hi> you have itching ears, and you heap up Teachers according to your luſts, and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:94121:29"/>the ſimplicity of the Goſpel is neglected; plain, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and ſincere preaching to the Conſcience, which would do your ſouls good, you are weary of; many look for new and ſtrange things, Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries out of the Fathers, and Heathen Authors to pleaſe their itching ears; they look after learning and not after the Goſpel; but ſuch things will not ſave you, it's the Goſpel, and the ſimplicity of it will do your ſouls good; I am jealous of you ſaith <hi>Paul;</hi> So I am jealous over you leaſt you ſhould be led away by the deluſions of <hi>Satan,</hi> led away by this world, led away by the evils and errors of the times; well take heed of all may cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt your minds, and make you unſound.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Is a ſound mind ſo deſirable, then be adviſed, and take heed whom you do make your familiar friends, and converſe familiarly with all: If men have not ſound minds there's great danger, for their breath will be ſtinking, and they will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect you; if men breath out corrupt words, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt opinions, corrupt doctrines, corrupt princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, they will undo you; but as for them who are ſound hearted, make them your friends, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 10.15. <hi>Is thine heart right, as my heart is with thy heart,</hi> ſaid <hi>Jehu</hi> to <hi>Jehonadab;</hi> yes, ſaith he, my heart is right, then he takes him up into the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot; So, queſtion whether mens hearts are ſound or no; if their hearts be ſound, then take them up into the Chariot of your hearts, otherwiſe no; a heart not right, will never be faithful, it's hard to find ſuch a man; who can find a man of a faithful heart, of ſound principles, of a healthy conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that is free from hyppocriſie, and ends, and reachings, and over-reachings? well, ſuch a one
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:94121:30"/>if thou canſt find him, make him thy familiar, make him thy friend; <hi>David</hi> makes <hi>Jonathan</hi> his friend, and ſuch thou mayeſt truſt who are ſound hearted; they dare not wrong the ſoundneſs of their hearts, but they labour to preſerve it, and in preſerving that, they preſerve friendſhip with thee.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Let us all examine what our hearts are, whether we have ſound hearts or no, whether our hearts be ſound in Gods Statutes yea or no; 'twas that <hi>David</hi> begged at the hand of God, 'twas that he knew was of great worth; 'tis that we ſhould all look after; well let us enquire, and for diſcovery hereof, I ſhall give you ſundry parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, A ſound heart is very inquiſitive into the nature of perſons or things, what they are before it entertains them; a ſound heart will not be over credulous, but will try them; <hi>Try the Spirits</hi> ſaith <hi>John,</hi> a found heart will try the Spirits, <hi>Job</hi> 34.32. <hi>That which I ſee not, teach thou me:</hi> O Lord teach me, I am afraid leaſt I ſhould be deceived; O teach me, tell me the nature of this man, of this woman, of this and that opinion; <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Prove all things, hold faſt that which is good;</hi> prove them as Gold, bring them to the fire, to the light, to the hammer, and when you have tryed them, then hold faſt; you will not pocket up Braſs Money, but ſay away with it; ſo ſound hearted Chriſtians will try perſons and opinions, and will not give them entertainment in their hearts, unleſs they be ſound; to the Law and to the Teſtimonie, and if they ſpeak not according to this word, there is no light in them.</p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:94121:30"/>
               <p> Secondly, A ſound heart doth find a great deal of ſweetneſs in the word of God, and digeſts it; it's like unto a healthy Stomach, a man that hath a healthy Stomach, he digeſts his meat, but a ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Stomach digeſts it not: Take a man now whoſe heart is ſound in Gods Statutes, he finds ſavour and ſweetneſs in Gods word, and doth reliſh and digeſt his word, and lives upon it; in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.10. ſaith <hi>David</hi> of the Statutes of the Lord, <hi>More are they to be deſired than Gold, yea, than much fine Gold; they are ſweeter than the Hony or the Hony Comb;</hi> how ſweet is Hony to you, and eſpecially when it drops from the Comb; ſaith <hi>David</hi> in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.103. <hi>How ſweet are thy words unto my taſt, yea, ſweeter than the Honey to my mouth:</hi> O Lord ſaith he, thy words they are ſweet words, they are ſweet to my mouth, they are ſweeter than Honey to my taſte; how ſweet are they? they are <hi>ſweeter</hi> than I can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs or conceive; how did he reliſh the truths of God? his meditation was in them night and day, <hi>And more do I eſteem them,</hi> ſaith <hi>Job, than my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed food:</hi> The word of God is the food of the ſoul, and a man that hath a ſound heart, he muſt live upon the word, he cannot go a day and not read the word, nor meditate on the promiſes; that's a ſickly, if not a dead heart which doth ſo; but a ſound heart will be feeding upon ſound truths, reliſh and digeſt the ſame.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, A heart that is ſound in the Statutes of God, doth look at the Statutes of God for themſelves, for their own ſakes; many you know do look at learning, they will learn at the Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar School, and they will profit at the Univerſity; but they do not look at learning for learning, but
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:94121:31"/>for credit, and to get a living, and be ſome body in the world; this is baſe: So many look at the Statutes of God, but not for the Statutes ſake; but that they may be encreaſed in knowledge, and be ſav'd at laſt; but a ſound heart looks at Gods Statutes for themſelves, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. <hi>I have choſen the way of truth;</hi> and <hi>v.</hi> 31. <hi>I have ſtuck unto thy Teſtimonies O God,</hi> and he ſaith, <hi>he doth prize them above thouſands of Gold and Silver, and above great ſpoils;</hi> and they are <hi>his Songs in the houſe of his Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage:</hi> why? he look'd at them for themſelves; O! Gods Statutes, they are ſuch precious truths, that let me have them, though I have nothing of the world: Some you know look at a Diamond, becauſe of the ſhining and ſparkling of it ſelf; not becauſe they ſhall Merchandize with it, and make themſelves rich: So that's ſound when a man looks at Gods divine truths, they are full of Glory, they are beams of Gods wiſdom, there's excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in them, this argues ſoundneſs of heart; but many look at the truths of God as ſuitable to their humours, they have ſuch a luſt, and this will agree with their luſt; and ſo they will pick here and there, which argues unſoundneſs; as a ſickly Stomach will pick a bit here and there; but a ſound heart looks at Gods Statutes for themſelves, and that excellency and worth is in them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, A ſound heart labours to know the will of God, and ſeeing it to be the will of God, ſticks not at hard things, at reproachful things; let the things be never ſo hard, never ſo reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, it ſticks not at it: well, is this the will of God ſaith the ſound heart, I will embrace it: ſaith Chriſt, <hi>It is written in the volume of thy Book
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:94121:31"/>that I ſhould do thy will, and loe I come;</hi> but conſider what this will is, thou muſt be a ſervant, thou muſt be perſecuted into <hi>Egypt,</hi> thy life muſt be ſought among the little Children, thou muſt be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an enemy to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> a breaker of the Sabbath, thou muſt be reproach'd, and hanged upon a Croſs, and be Crucifyed between Thieves and Murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, what wilt thou go now? I, it's written in the volume of thy Book, that I muſt do thy will, and loe I come, he ſticks not at any or all of theſe things; ſaith God to <hi>Abraham, Abraham,</hi> go and Sacrifice your onely Son <hi>Iſaac</hi> unto me; O Lord might he ſay, this is a hard buſineſs; what, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my Son? what will my Wife ſay? it will be her death; what will the Nations ſay? here was a bloody man to murther his Son, and ſo I may be put to death for it; I but it was the will of God, and ſo he ſtuck not at it.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, a ſound heart may be known by this, that it is willing and ready to part with any thing for the Lords ſake; ſaith a ſound heart, what will this do me good, if I loſe my integrity, if I loſe my ſincerity, if I loſe now my fitneſs to do God ſervice by defiling my ſelf: what ſhall I get? you know the young man comes to Chriſt, and ſaith, <hi>Good Maſter what ſhall I do to inherit eternal life?</hi> ſaith he, <hi>keep the Commandements. Why all theſe things have I kept from my youth up;</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>go and ſell all that thou haſt and give to the poor, and come and follow me, and thou ſhalt have treaſure in heaven.</hi> One would think, here had been promiſe enough for him, and treaſure enough for him; but he had rotten principles in him; he had the world in him, his heart was for the world, and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:94121:32"/>the creature, and nothing of it for God. <hi>Simon Magus</hi> went further than this man did, he was a Profeſſor, and got into a Church Relation; he brings out his bags of Gold and Silver, and would give them to the Apoſtles, that he might have that power they had, to give the Holy Ghoſt; but ſaith <hi>Peter</hi> thy heart is not right, therefore pray if it be poſſible that the thoughts of thy heart may be forgiven thee: But now a gracious heart in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, will part with all; ſaith <hi>Paul, I account all leſs and dung,</hi> Phil. 3. All my priviledges, all my learning, all that ever I have I account it loſs and dung for the excellency of the knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt; and ſay the Diſciples, Maſter, we have left all to follow thee; and you know <hi>Galeatius</hi> left all for Chriſts ſake, and comes to <hi>Geneva</hi> that he might enjoy the Goſpel: And the Martyrs they left their lives; what dearer than a mans life? yet they were ready to let go their lives, rather then to let go their foundneſs.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, A ſound heart is that which doth fill up all its relations, what relation ſoever it ſtands in towards God, towards man, towards the publick, towards its family; it will fill up its relations, <hi>Acts</hi> 24.16. ſaith <hi>Paul, herein do I exerciſe my ſelf, to have alwayes a Conſcience void of offence, towards God, and towards man;</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> I ſtand in relation to God, and I do exerciſe my ſelf in this, that I may have my Conſcience cleer and free; I will do all my duties towards God that he calls for, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe I ſhall not have a Conſcience free; and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men, in every relation I ſtand in towards men, I am careful to fill up thoſe relations. So that a ſound heart is wonderful cautious in doing any
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:94121:32"/>thing in any relation that may not fill up its rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; as <hi>Joſhua,</hi> Ch. 24.15. <hi>Let others do what they will, I and my houſe will ſerve the Lord:</hi> Others will ſerve their luſts, and ſerve the times, and ſerve men, and ſerve Devils; but I and my houſe will ſerve the Lord: I am Maſter of this Family, and I will ſee my Wife and Children, and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and all under my roof, to ſerve the Lord; ſo ſaith God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> I know that he will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct and teach his Family, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.19. And ſo <hi>David,</hi> in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 101. I will walk in my houſe with a perfect heart, I will not ſuffer a wicked perſon to ſtay within my Family. No Drunkard, no Swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, no Sabbath-Breaker, no prophane wretch ſhall ſtay in my Family: So that a ſound heart fills up its relations: ſome make no Conſcience at all of their places, they are unfaithful, they can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be truſted in any place they are in, but they have no ſound hearts; Husbands to Wives, Wives to Husbands, if not careful to pleaſe one another according to the word of God, their hearts are not ſound; if Children be not obedient to their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, Servants ſerving their Maſters, not with eye-ſervice, but with ſingleneſs of heart as unto the Lord, their hearts are not ſound; many will hear the word of God, and talk of good things, but care not for doing their duties in their places: how do they fill up their relations; but now, if you be ſound hearted you will fill up your rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions you ſtand in.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, a ſound heart can bear ſharp affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions very quietly and meekly, a ſore Shoulder will bear no burthen, a Horſe with a gall'd back will winch, and kick, and fling; take a hand that
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:94121:33"/>the skin is off, and pour vinegar upon it, or lay Salt upon it, and how terrible is it? but if the hand be ſound it can bear it; if the Shoulder be ſound it can bear a burthen; if the Horſe be ſound, he can bear the Rider; ſo a ſound heart can bear any burthen; <hi>Moſes</hi> was a meek man, and he bore all the burthen; that was upon him: But now if the heart be not ſound, there's fretting, murmuring, and repining; when the heart is not ſound every little thing doth diſturb and diſquiet it but when its ſound, it's like Chriſt's heart, it can bear all burthens whatſoever.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, A ſound heart is the ſame towards God in the darkeſt diſpenſations that can be, as it is to God in the ſweeteſt diſpenſations that may be: when God carries it moſt ſtrangely, and moſt enemy-like unto the ſoul, that ſoul is the ſame towards God ſtill, as it was towards God before in the moſt ſweet and pleaſing diſpenſations; ſaith <hi>Hab.</hi> in his 3. ch. <hi>Though the Fig-tree ſhould not bloſſem, neither ſhould fruit be in the Vine, the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of the Olive ſhould fail, the fields ſhould yield no meat, the flock ſhall be cut off from the ſoul, and there ſhall be no heard in the Stall; yet will I rejoyce in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my Salvation:</hi> Though there be ſo great a famine as there is nothing left without or within, yet will I rejoyce in God; a man uſes to rejoyce in God when he hath abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the creature; but ſaith <hi>Hab.</hi> Though none of all theſe be, and there be nothing but fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, and I am ready to periſh, yet will I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in the Lord, his heart was ſound, and he was the ſame towards God in one diſpenſation as in another; So <hi>Job</hi> in the 13. ch. 15. v. <hi>Though he
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:94121:33"/>ſlay me, yet will I truſt in him:</hi> I truſted him when I had all things abounding about me, and I will truſt in him when all things are taken from me; a ſound heart is the ſame at all times; <hi>Who is among you that feareth the Lord, that obeyeth the voice of his Servant, which walketh in darkneſs and hath no light? Let him truſt in the name of the Lord, and ſtay himſelf upon his God:</hi> A ſound heart will truſt in God in Winter, as well as in Summer; in a Dark night, as well as in a Sun ſhine day; in <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. <hi>I have learned,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, in whatever eſtate I am, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to be content;</hi> I can want, and I can abound; God hath made my heart ſound, and I can rejoyce in all conditions: The <hi>Cananitiſh</hi> woman, Chriſt calls her <hi>Dog,</hi> here was a dark diſpenſation, but ſhe calls him <hi>Lord:</hi> Lord the Dogs eat the Crumbs that fall from their Maſters Table: So that if your hearts be ſound in the Statutes, and in the things of God, your hearts will be the ſame to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God in adverſity as in proſperity, in ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as in health, in poverty as in glory and honour.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, a ſound heart will never turn aſide from God, or out of his way, upon any pretence, perſwaſion, or advantage whatſoever; but keeps on in Gods way, in the Kings road, in the way of holineſs, in the way of truth, in the way of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs; it keeps on in this way, and will not be warp'd or turned aſide; it's ſaid in 1 <hi>K.</hi> 15.5. That <hi>David</hi> did that which was right in the ſight of the Lord, and turned not aſide from any thing that he commanded him all the dayes of his life, ſave onely in the matter of <hi>Uriah</hi> the <hi>Hittie</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> through ſome violent temptations <hi>David</hi> turned
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:94121:34"/>aſide once; but now here was the integrity and ſoundneſs of his heart, that he did that which was right in the ſight of the Lord, and turned not aſide from the things that he commanded him all the dayes of his life; ſo that a ſound heart will not turn aſide; 'tis not flattery, 'tis not fear, 'tis not advantage will make him do it; but God is God, Truth is Truth; as Chriſt hated iniquity and loved righteouſneſs, ſo doth a ſound heart; this is the way of God, and I will go this way ſaith a ſound heart; in the 11. <hi>Acts,</hi> they cleave to God with purpoſe of heart; the Apoſtle would not take money to give unto <hi>Simon Magus</hi> the gift of the Holy Ghoſt; and a ſound heart it will not be brib'd, it will not be couzened, it will not turn to the left hand or to the right hand, but goes right forward to the end of the way.</p>
               <p>Tenthly, A ſound heart hath a ſpiritual confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and boldneſs in it, and can come unto the Lord in another manner than an unſound and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt heart can; I ſay it hath a ſpiritual boldneſs and conſidence in it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.19.22. <hi>having therefore Brethren boldneſs to enter into the holyeſt by the blood of Jeſus;</hi> how comes any to have a ſpiritual boldneſs? he muſt have his heart ſound if he have any boldneſs in him; if his heart be guilty, if his heart be corrupt and rotten, there can be no boldneſs nor confidence; but being ſound, a man hath boldneſs to enter into the holieſt by the blood of Jeſus. A man that hath intereſt in the blood of Jeſus, hath a ſound heart, and v. 22. <hi>Let us draw near with a true heart, in full aſſurance of Faith, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our hearts ſprinkled from an evil Conſcience;</hi> here's that makes the heart good, and makes the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:94121:34"/>heart bold; when the heart is ſprinkled with the blood of Chriſt, the Conſcience is made ſound and good: and being thus, now let us draw near with a true heart, in full aſſurance; ſuch a heart as is ſound, may come with aſſurance and confidence unto God, and beg of God what he ſtands in need of: this is the nature of a ſound heart.</p>
               <p n="11">11. A ſound heart depends upon God alone for all ſpiritual mercies, in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>But of him are ye in Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> that is, of God are we in Chriſt Jeſus; God hath drawn you to Chriſt, and ſtated you in Chriſt; ſo that of <hi>him are ye in Chriſt Jeſus, who of God is made unto us Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, Sanctification, and Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> who of God is made unto us. Thoſe that are in Chriſt Jeſus have ſoundneſs of heart, they have the very heart and mind of Chriſt: now ſaith he, who of God is made unto us, Wiſdom, Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Sanctification and Redemption: That ſoul depends upon God for Wiſdome from Chriſt, for Sanctification from Chriſt, for Righteouſneſs from Chriſt; for Redemption from Chriſt, it doth not depend upon its own Acts, its own Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences, its own Graces, its own Comforts; it doth not depend upon the Law, it doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the Goſpel, but upon God through Chriſt; ſo that a ſound heart ſees through all unto God, who is the root and fountain, and fetches all from thence; it takes up all from God, from God through a Covenant of Grace, from God through Chriſt; ſo that as it is in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.24. <hi>Verily ſhall one ſay, in the Lord have I righteouſneſs and ſtrength;</hi> I have it not from an Ordinance, I have it not in my ſelf, but from God through Chriſt, from God through an Ordinance, ſaith
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:94121:35"/>
                  <hi>David,</hi> my ſoul wait thou onely upon the Lord, for from him cometh thine expectation.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Laſtly, for diſcovery of a ſound heart; a ſound heart is that conforms to Gods word, not to the world, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. beginning; <hi>be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to this world; but be ye transformed by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing of your minds, that ye may prove what is that good, that acceptable, and perfect will of God.</hi> When a man is transformed by the renewing of his mind, he is a ſound minded, a ſound hearted man; but till then he is a corrupt hearted man: Now if you be ſound hearted, you will not conform to the world; but to the word, which is the will of God revealed; That good, that acceptable, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect will of God you will conform to; ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> in 6. <hi>Gal.</hi> 14. I am Crucified to the world; he now conforms to the good and acceptable will of God; for God would have us to look at Chriſt Crucified, and to dye to ſin through the death of Chriſt, and <hi>Paul</hi> looks at Chriſt Crucified, and is dead to the world, and the world was dead to him, he would not conform to the world; a ſound heart conforms not to the world, worldly worſhip, worldly cuſtomes, worldly faſhions, worldly manners, but conforms to the word, therefore look to it; for few ſound hearted there are, ſo many conform to the world, and ſo few to the word; but a ſound heart will conform to ſound Doctrine, the ſound word, and not to the world that lyes in wickedneſs: and thus you ſee ſeveral diſcoveries of a ſound heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 4. The fourth Uſe is of conſolation, of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to all thoſe that find they have ſound hearts; have you ſound hearts? hearts well principled
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:94121:35"/>with divine truth? have you hearts undivided and carried wholly to God? have you hearts that are healthy and ſound? have you hearts that have truth of grace in them? hearts without hypocriſie and guile? hearts ſet for God, to do his will? you are then fit for Gods uſe and ſervice, you are then like to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, you are precious in the ſight of God, you are dear unto him, you have a bleſſedneſs then upon you; I, you are differenced, from all hypocrites, and ſuch as ſhall periſh; you are thoſe that ſhall hold out to the end, you will be the honour and glory of the Goſpel, you will be the honour and glory of the Miniſtry, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.8. <hi>For now we live if ye ſtand faſt in the Lord:</hi> O you <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> we live if you ſtand faſt; if you be ſound hearted, you will ſtand faſt, you will continue to the end, and this will be our life; I, it will be your honour, and your Crown and Glory, if you ſtand faſt; So that here's comfort, and great comfort to thoſe are ſound hearted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 5. The fifth and laſt uſe of this point is to exhort men and women to labour to get ſoundneſs of heart, ſound minds, ſound ſpirits; ſee to it; for 'tis of concernment, that you have ſound hearts; Lord, ſaith <hi>David,</hi> let my heart be ſound in thy Statutes, O Lord let me have a heart ſound in thy Statutes, though I have no Kingdom, though I have no Army, though I have no outward Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts; yet let me have a ſound heart.</p>
               <p>I ſhall here firſt ſhew you how you may get a ſound heart. Secondly, how you may keep a ſound heart. Thirdly, ſome motives to preſs you on to it.</p>
               <p>Firſt, how to come to have a ſound heart.</p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:94121:36"/>
               <p> Firſt, If you would have ſoundneſs of heart, then labour to cleanſe out of your hearts all that may corrupt your hearts, or make your hearts unſound; you know a Garment, if it have Dirt in it, Moths in it, wet in it, it will corrupt the Garment; therefore you will take a courſe to get out the Moths, and to dry it, and to beat out the duſt, that ſo your Garments may be ſound; if there be worms in the timber, it will rot and conſume the timber; If there be ill humors in the body, you muſt out with them, or they will deſtroy the body; ſo if you would have ſound hearts, you muſt cleanſe out all that is of a corrupting nature; there are two things that make a corrupt heart principally. Firſt, Erroneous opinions and principles. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Mens luſts. Now as for errors, they are call'd <hi>the errors of the wicked;</hi> wicked men take in wicked errors, wicked opinions, corrupt opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and theſe make corrupt minds corrupt conſciences, corrupt hearts, and corrupt men and women: and ſo luſts, they are <hi>deceitful luſts; defil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing luſts,</hi> Ephe. 4.22. <hi>That ye put off concerning the former Converſation, the old man which is corrupt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to deceitful luſts:</hi> if you have a luſt of envy, envy is rottenneſs to the bones, if a luſt of pride, uncleanneſs, of covetouſneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> you muſt put them off, you muſt cleanſe your ſelves from them, you muſt waſh and ſcower your hearts; ſo that if you would have ſound hearts, away with corrupt opinions, away with deceitful and corrupt luſts.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if you would have ſound hearts, then labour to get ſound truths into them, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Hold faſt the form of ſound words which thou haſt learned of me: Timothy,</hi> I have taught thee whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:94121:36"/>and ſound Doctrine, I have Preached unto thee the Goſpel of Chriſt, I have given thee Rules and Laws whereby to direct thee; hold faſt the pattern or form of ſound words, or of wholſom words; there are corrupt words which are not ſound; there are corrupting words, and ſuch words do a great deal of hurt, as in the 2 <hi>Ch.</hi> 17. <hi>v.</hi> and <hi>their words do eat as doth a Canker,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe are corrupting words; gangreening words, words that eat out ſoundneſs, when men come with ſuch opinions, as there's no Chriſt, no God, no Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, no Hell; and theſe Scriptures are not the word of God; Oh what Gangreening words are theſe; therefore hold faſt the pattern of wholſom words, get ſound words into your hearts, and they will make your hearts found: <hi>Solomon</hi> tells you of <hi>ſound wiſdom,</hi> Prov. 3.21. keep ſound wiſdom and diſcretion, there is an unſound wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, the wiſdome of the world, the wiſdom of the fleſh: The word for <hi>ſound wiſdom,</hi> is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which notes <hi>eſſence;</hi> the Law of God is <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> it is eſſence; get the truths of God into your hearts, and theſe will be eſſence, ſoundneſs and ſubſtance unto you: thy Law is within my heart ſaith <hi>David,</hi> and the Law was written in Chriſts heart, and they had ſoundneſs of heart; ſo that the way to have found hearts, is to get ſound truths into your hearts.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if you would have ſound hearts, be much in examination of your hearts. Many go from week to week, and year to year, and never examine what hearts they have; but you ſhould examine your hearts frequently, daily, and the more the better; you will look to your houſes,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:94121:37"/>that they be wind tite and weather tite, you will look to your Ships whether they leak or no, and will you not look to your hearts, whether they be wind tite or weather tite? whether any wind of Doctrine have got into them? whether any cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt luſts do ſtir in them? examine and ſay, what's my heart? is it ſound in the Faith? hath it ſound principles? is it healthy? is it undivided? hath it true grace? is it free from hypocriſie? if you examine your hearts, you will mind them and know what's in them; the Scripture puts you up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, you have examples and Commands, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Examine your ſelves whether you be in the faith or no, prove your own ſelves;</hi> try whether you be Gold or Silver, true Gold or counterfeit Gold; <hi>prove your ſelves, know ye not your own ſelves how that Jeſus Chriſt is in you, unleſs you be Reprobates;</hi> what, will you leave it at randome whether you be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates or no? when a man comes to try himſelf, and finds he is ſick, mortally wounded, or hath a pluriſie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he wil ſeek for remedy; ſo if you would take pains this way, you would come to ſoundneſs of heart quickly; in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.6. <hi>I commune with mine own heart, and my Spirit made diligent ſearch.</hi> Commune with your own hearts, let your Spirits make diligent ſearch if there be no worms, no weeds, no ill principles there, and that's the way to come to ſoundneſs of heart, therefore be much in examination.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If you would have ſoundneſs of heart, then be ſure not to bring your own ſence to the Scriptures, but learn to know the ſence of Scripture, and take up Scripture ſence; many have unſound hearts becauſe they put ſences upon the truths of God,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:94121:37"/>which they never will bear: You erre ſaid Chriſt to the Sadduces, not knowing the Scriptures; therefore bring not your ſences to the Scriptures, but take the Scripture ſence, and lay by your own; and that you may have that, compare ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual things with ſpiritual, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.13. we compare one Scripture with another, and ſee whether it will hold currant; for one Scripture may be dark, yet another may be light, and ſo the Scripture may go hand in hand: therefore if you would have ſound hearts, take the ſence of God in Scripture, his mind in his word, and not the opinions of men of corrupt minds, or of your own fancies.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Would you have ſoundneſs of heart? then be willing to hearken to reproof, that's a thing that few can bear, but it ſhews they have unſound hearts; reproof is call'd, a reproof of life; and you ſhall find it's the way to have ſoundneſs of heart to hearken to reproof; for every man is ſubject to erre and may ſtep aſide; now reproof is a healing Medicine, and doth much good, <hi>Prov.</hi> 5.12. ſaith he, <hi>how have I hated Inſtruction, and my heart deſpiſed reproof;</hi> my heart deſpiſed reproof, and therefore I have had an unſound heart that hath gone out after women, and ſpent eſtate and ſtrength, and contracted guilt, the wrath and diſpleaſure of God, and what was the ground of it? <hi>why, I deſpiſed reproof;</hi> now look into the 15. ch. 31. v. <hi>The ear that heareth the reproof of life abideth among the wiſe;</hi> why, art thou dead, and haſt a rotten and unſound heart? a reproof is the reproof of life; and when life comes, ſoundneſs comes; now if thy ear hearken to the reproof of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:94121:38"/>life, thou abideſt among the wiſe, and <hi>v.</hi> 32. <hi>he that refuſeth Inſtruction, deſpiſeth his own ſoul; but he that heareth reproof, getteth underſtanding:</hi> So that to hearken to reproof, reproof of Parents, reproof of Maſters, reproof of Miniſters, he that hearkens to theſe gets underſtanding, they prove the reproofs of life; and ſee in 1 <hi>Tit.</hi> 13. <hi>This witneſs is true, wherefore rebuke them ſharply, that they may be ſound in the faith;</hi> ſharp rebukes make ſoundneſs in the faith, this is out of practice in our dayes, were it more in practice, that one friend would deal impartially with another in a wiſe and humble way, this would make ſound hearts every where.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Laſtly, to get a ſound heart go unto God, who hath the hearts of all in his hand, and can turn them and change them as he pleaſe, and make them ſound though they be never ſo corrupt and rotten; <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.7. <hi>He layeth up ſound wiſdom for the Righteous;</hi> Parents lay up ſound wealth for their Children, and God layeth up ſound wiſdom for his, and <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.14. <hi>Counſel is mine, and ſound wiſdom;</hi> there's none hath true Counſel, and ſound wiſdom to give but God, wiſdom that hath eſſence and ſubſtance in it; therefore go to the Lord, and intreat him to give you of this ſound wiſdom. And you muſt go to him in good earneſt, go and <hi>cry</hi> to him for it; <hi>Prov.</hi> 2. <hi>If thou cryeſt after knowledge, and lifteſt up thy voice for underſtanding; if thou ſeekeſt her as Silver, and ſearcheſt for her as for hid Treaſures: Then ſhalt thou underſtand the fear of the Lord, and find the knowledge of God.</hi> If you will cry for her, and uſe means to get ſound wiſdom, God will give it, for he hath lay'd it up on purpoſe for you;
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:94121:38"/>you are directed and ſhewed the way to get it: therefore cry to God, and put forth your utmoſt ſtrength and power to get ſound wiſdom, that you may have ſoundneſs of heart, and deſire God to give you his holy ſpirit, and that will make your hearts ſound indeed; for ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>God hath not given us the Spirit of fear, but of power, of love, and of a ſound mind;</hi> Gods ſpirit is a ſpirit of truth, a ſpirit of wiſdom, a ſpirit of a ſound mind; and will make you have a ſound mind whenſoever it comes into you.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing is to know how to preſerve a ſound mind when you have gotten it.</p>
               <p>Firſt, have nothing to do with thoſe that are unſound, neither unſound men, nor unſound books; have nothing to do with them; do you think ever to preſerve your ſelves in a ſound heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy condition if you will run where the Plague, the Pox, and the Leproſie are? 'tis impoſſible you ſhould; but if you will preſerve health, you will keep from theſe; ſo if you would preſerve your hearts ſound, have nothing to do with unſound men, or unſound books; <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.10. <hi>A man that is an Heretick after the firſt and ſecond admonition reject:</hi> have nothing to do with him, but to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh him, and tell him of his corrupt opinions, and after the firſt and ſecond admonition reject him; his Hereſie may ſpread, his words may be a Gangrene and may eat up the ſoundneſs of thy heart, if thou wilt have to do with him; and ſo in the ſecond Epiſtle of <hi>John, Look to your ſelves, that we loſe not thoſe things which we have wrought; but that we receive a full reward, for whoſoever tranſgreſſeth and abideth not in the Doctrine of Chriſt, hath not God;
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:94121:39"/>he that abideth in the Doctrine of Chriſt, he hath both the Father and the Son; If there come any unto you, and bring not this Doctrine, receive him not into your houſe, neither bid him God ſpeed.</hi> If any one come unto you, and bring not the Doctrine of Chriſt, the Doctrine of Chriſt in the true ſence of Chriſt; but with their own fancies, ſences, gloſſes, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt mixtures, receive him not into your houſe, and what will you receive him into your hearts? bid him not God ſpeed, but bid him be gone like a Deceiver, an Impoſter, a Jugler, an Enemy to God and Chriſt: and in <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.17. ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>I beſeech you Brethren, mark them which cauſe diviſione and offences, contrary to the Doctrine which ye have learned, and avoid them:</hi> If men come with Doctrines and opinions, contrary to the Doctrine you have received,

               <p>Secondly, if you would preſerve your hearts ſound, then take pains about your hearts to keep down all luſts that are ſtirring; for unleſs you keep under your luſts, you will never keep ſound hearts; you muſt do by your hearts as by your Gardens, would you have a neat garden? you are oft digging, oft cutting down the weeds; ſo you muſt do with your hearts; when any luſts ariſes you muſt be ſure to keep them under; do as by your Sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ions and opinion; and when they hear of a man
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:94121:39"/>hath ſome new doctrine, new notions, or new opinion, they muſt hear him; but mortifie this luſt, this humour, and then you ſhall live, live ſound in the faith, and dye comfortably, dye in the Faith, dye in the Lord; but if you will not, you are in hazard of miſcarrying ſoul and body to all Eternity: Therefore ſaith <hi>Solomon, keep thy heart with all diligence.</hi> Suffer not any luſt to get in; ſuffer not any truth to ſtart out; therefore keep your hearts with all diligence.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Would you preſerve your hearts ſound, then be much converſant in the word of God: that which makes a ſound heart, preſerves a ſound heart; the form or pattern of wholſom words is the word of God; ſo your minding and meditating on the word of God, &amp; keeping to the word of God, will keep your hearts ſound, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. <hi>O how I love thy Law! it is my meditation all the day:</hi> I love thy Law for it ſelf, I love thy Law for its purity, I love thy Law for its ſoundneſs, and for the ſoundneſs it works in my heart; I love thy Law, and it is my meditation all the <hi>day,</hi> and all the <hi>night</hi> too, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.2. and <hi>Pſ.</hi> 119.104. <hi>Through thy precepts I get underſtanding, therefore I hate every falſe way:</hi> If there be a falſe way without, I hate that; if there be a falſe way within, I hate that; ſo that if you would have a ſound heart, meditate much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the word of God; his words are wholſom words, and make the heart ſounder and ſounder every day.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, if you would have your hearts ſound, then whatſoever the ſickneſs or diſeaſe be, put forth frequent acts of faith upon Chriſt Crucified; about Chriſt and his Death, Chriſt and his blood,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:94121:40"/>Chriſt and his merits, Chriſt ſuffering for ſin and Sinners: the more faith is acted upon Chriſt Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, the more ſound will be your hearts, for the blood and death of Chriſt are of a cleanſing virtue, a ſin-killing virtue, a ſoul-healing virtue, and will make your hearts gracious and ſound in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.7. <hi>The blood of Chriſt cleanſeth us from all ſin:</hi> if we do believe in him, his blood clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes from all ſin, cleanſeth from all the guilt of ſin, and purges the dead works out of your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences; it cleanſes from the power of ſin, and there will be a death upon your Corruptions: O look upon him whom you have pierced ſo often with your ſin, and put forth acts of faith, and you will find virtue from Chriſt, and will dye to ſin, and live to God.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, If you would be ſound hearted men and women, and not led away with errors, nor with the evils of the times, then have God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly in your eye; God is preſent every where, he is in you all, through you all, and over you all: And did you ſee God, and ſet God before you, and acknowledge Gods preſence and eye upon you, you would not meddle with weeds, you would not meddle with errors, you would not give way to luſts, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 16. ſaith <hi>David,</hi> I have ſet God at my right hand and therefore I ſhall not fall, I have ſet God alwayes before me, I look upon God, and I ſee God looking upon me, God is at my right hand, I can do nothing but what God would have me do, therefore I ſhall not be moved; the Corruptions of my heart ſhall not move me to go this way or that way; but I will keep them under, and not ſuffer them to riſe and
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:94121:40"/>appear in the ſight of God: did men and women more mind God, the preſence and authority of God over them, they would not be led away, nor entertain nor practice corrupt things, but they would approve themſelves to God, and then the heart is ſound when it is approv'd to God.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Laſtly, if you would keep your hearts ſound, regard oft your latter end, remember Death, remember Account, remember Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; ſaith the Lord, <hi>O that they were wiſe, that they underſtood this, that they would remember their latter end;</hi> they go out to other Gods, and falſe worſhip, and they practice baſe things, violence and blood is among them, but what's the reaſon of it? they are not wiſe, they dont underſtand this, they do not remember their latter end, that they muſt dye, that they muſt give account, that they muſt be judged and diſpoſed of to all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Did they remember this, they would never leave me nor my wayes, nor be ſeduced, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if you would keep your hearts ſound, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber your latter end; you muſt dye, you muſt give account to God, and be judged to all Eternity.</p>
               <p>Now ſome Arguments, or motives, why men and women ſhould keep their hearts ſound.</p>
               <p>Firſt, you ſhould do this, becauſe there's an hour of Temptation coming upon you; <hi>Rev.</hi> 3 10. <hi>Becauſe thou haſt kept the word of my patience, I alſo will keep thee from the hour of Temptation, which ſhall come upon all the world to try them:</hi> there is an hour of Temptation that muſt come upon the whole world to try them; what will become of you now if you have unſound hearts, when the time of
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:94121:41"/>Temptation comes: if you be ſtubble you will burn, if you be rotten you will be thrown by, if you be unſound, wo be to you; there is an hour a coming, and an hour of Temptation, and it will try men and women to the quick; well, if God will come and try you, then get ſound hearts, and keep ſound hearts; for there will be ſuch an hour e're long: Nay is there not ſuch an hour at this time, God is ſifting and trying the Nation by wayes and means that ſeem beſt in his wiſdom, to diſcover Men what they are: and it may come upon you and your Families very ſuddainly, a fiery Tryal may come upon you.</p>
               <p>Secondly, We ſhould do it, becauſe there are very few men ad women in the world have ſound hearts; In <hi>Sodom</hi> there was one <hi>Lot</hi> had a ſound heart; but what had all the reſt? in the old world there was one <hi>Noah</hi> found favour and grace in the eyes of God, and had a ſound heart, he was ſound in the faith, and ſound hearted towards God and his worſhip; 'tis very rare and hard to find a ſound hearted man, a faithful man, ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi> who can find? one of a thouſand; he found but one man of a thouſand, and in <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. <hi>All ſeek their own and none ſeek the things of Chriſt:</hi> It's very rare, very hard to find out a ſound hearted man.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Conſider, that an unſound heart is very grievous and burthenſom; like a ſore leg or a ſore arm, O how burthenſom and grievous is it? but what if a broken leg or arm, that's more bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenſom; if you have unſound hearts, you will be full of guilt and full of fears, and this will be a burthen unto you, and a great burthen unto you to have guilt and fears upon your ſpirits, they may
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:94121:41"/>ſink you; ſee what the wiſe man ſaith, in <hi>Pro.</hi> 14.30. <hi>A ſound heart is the life of the fleſh, but envy the rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenneſs of the bones.</hi> A ſound heart is the life of the fleſh; if a man be ſound hearted, he will be live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and chearful; but if he be unſound hearted, he will be like a dead man; <hi>envy</hi> is the rottenneſs of the bones; every ſin tends to it: if a man have an unſound heart, he will have many luſts and ſins, and every one will be rottenneſs to his bones; <hi>Nabal,</hi> his heart was as a ſtone within him, the righteous is bold as a Lyon; he is full of courage and mettle; but a wicked man, he that hath an unſound heart, he flyes when none purſues him: his heart is his torment, his heart is his hell, it will be a burthen unto him.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, A man ſhould labour to keep his heart ſound, otherwiſe he can never love the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in truth; an unſound hearted man, will love ſomewhat elſe more than Chriſt; but <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. laſt, <hi>grace be with all them that love our Lord Jeſus Chriſt in ſincerity;</hi> a man of an unſound heart, cannot love Chriſt in ſincerity, for ſincerity is one part of a ſound heart: if therefore you would love the Lord Jeſus in ſincerity, in truth, get ſoundneſs of heart, and keep your hearts ſound: let not your hearts be divided; let not your hearts be Hypocritical; they are unſound hearts, but let your hearts be ſincere, and then you will love the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in ſincerity; but if you do not, what ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.22. <hi>If any man love not the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, let him be</hi> Anathema, Maranatha: If any man love not the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that is, if he love him not in ſincerity, for if he ſeem to love him, and it be otherwiſe, ſo
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:94121:42"/>much the worſe, he will have <hi>Anathema</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ha</hi> with advantage; if you have an unſound heart you cannot love Chriſt ſincerely; but now if you would have this teſtimony that you love the Lord Jeſus in ſincerity, <hi>get</hi> ſoundneſs of heart, <hi>keep</hi> ſoundneſs of heart.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, you ſhould do this, becauſe the Lord himſelf is coming to Judgment, <hi>James</hi> 5.9. <hi>grudge not one againſt another Brethren, leaſt ye be condemned, behold the Judge ſtandeth before the door:</hi> The Judge is very near, he is knocking at your door, he is coming to Judge you, and it will not be long but you muſt be Judged, and the Lord (I ſay) ſtands at the door, therefore look to it that your hearts be ſound: what will become of you if the Lord find you Hypocrites, if the Lord find you unſound hearted men and women, if he find your hearts are divided between him and the world; that they are ſick with luſts, that you are under the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of ſin, that you have but ſeeming grace and not real grace, what will become of you? the Judge is at the door, and you may go this night for ought you know: Thou fool this night ſhall thy ſoul be taken from thee: look to it that your hearts be ſound, for God will ſearch you to the quick, he will diſcover men and women what they are to the full, and open every ſecret.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Laſtly, labour for ſoundneſs of heart upon the account of the Text, <hi>Let my heart be ſound in thy Statutes, that I be not aſhamed:</hi> you will be aſhamed one day if your hearts be not ſound: And ſo I come to the laſt point; and that is,</p>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:94121:42"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>Obſ.</hi> 4. That thoſe that have not ſoundneſs of hearts, ſooner or later will be made aſhamed. In <hi>Prov.</hi> 26.26. <hi>whoſe hatred is covered by deceit, his wickedneſs ſhall be ſhewed before the whole Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> when men do cover up their wickedneſs and have unſound hearts, they hate their Neighbor and give them ſweet words and the like; but they hate them in their hearts: and the man whoſe hatred is covered by deceit, his wickedneſs ſhall be diſcovered before the whole Congregation: <hi>Laodicea</hi> was luke-warm, and had a rotten heart, and did not God ſay, I will ſpew thee out of my mouth? <hi>Judas</hi> had a rotten heart, and was he not diſcovered and aſhamed? <hi>Judas</hi> the Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor: and the Scripture is full of ſuch inſtances every where, there is no need to ſtick upon it.</p>
               <p>Now for the word <hi>Shame.</hi> (not to trouble you with many things) There be three things make a man aſhamed; all which will be found in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound heart.</p>
               <p>Firſt, when a man ſhall be found that which others did not think him to be, and he thought not himſelf to be: as when a man is prov'd a Bankrupt; others thought him to be a man of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit and wealth, and it may be he did not think himſelf to be one; but when he comes to be prov'd to be one, he is diſcovered to be that he was not; ſo in <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. Thou haſt tryed them, and found them Lyars; they ſaid they were Apoſtles, but they were found by the Church to be no Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, but Lyars, and now they were aſhamed: ſo they that ſaid they were Jews and were not; but he's a Jew that is one inwardly, and not outwardly only, unſound hearted men will be found <hi>that</hi> which
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:94121:43"/>they are not in their own apprehenſion, and in the judgments of others; now this will bring ſhame, when men ſhall be found that which they are not at preſent; and which they were not in the judgment of others.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that which brings ſhame is diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment: when men are diſappointed of their expectations, <hi>Jer.</hi> 14. <hi>And their Nobles ſent their little ones to the waters, they came to the pits and found no water, they returned with their veſſels empty, they were aſhamed, and confounded, and covered their heads.</hi> So that diſappointment cauſes ſhame, as in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 20.5. <hi>They ſhall be afraid and aſhamed of</hi> Ethiopia <hi>their expectation, and of</hi> Egypt <hi>their Glory;</hi> So that when men are diſappointed of their expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations, then they are aſhamed; now unfound hearted men they will be diſappointed of their expectations; they look for Comfort, Peace, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, happineſs and Glory, but they ſhall be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed, the five fooliſh Virgins, they thought to go in to Heaven, but they were diſappointed of their expectation, and ſo greatly aſhamed.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, When great evils not look'd for come upon men and women, then they are aſhamed; 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.5. The men were greatly aſhamed; there were Ambaſſadors ſent to <hi>Hanan,</hi> and he cuts off half their Beards, and half their Garments, and here was evil come upon them they look'd not for, and they were greatly aſhamed; ſo men that are unſound will have evils come upon them that they look'd not for; God will bring evil upon them that they look'd not for, evil upon their States, and evil upon their Names, and evils upon their Bodies and Souls, and this will make them aſhamed.</p>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:94121:43"/>
               <p> Now this ſhame frequently is in this Life, but alwayes at the day of Judgment.</p>
               <p>In this life, how are men aſham'd? what a multitude of men in theſe dayes are diſcovered to be unſound hearted, full of rotten principles, Errors, Hereſies, and ſinful complyances? and this is their ſhame: what a multitude have divided hearts between God and <hi>Mammon?</hi> what a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude are diſcovered to have but ſeeming grace, and no truth of grace in them? what a multitude of Hypocrites have we in the world, that have pretended fair and high, and yet now their Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie appears? they have left the ſweet Grapes of <hi>Canaan,</hi> for the ſtinking Garlick of <hi>Egypt,</hi> what a multitude have we whoſe hearts are not ſet to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice what they hear? theſe are all unſound heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and theſe are diſcovered, and more and more ſhall be diſcovered daily. But at laſt when the Goats ſhall be ſet at the left hand, and the Sheep at the right hand, and Chriſt ſhall ſay go ye Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, go ye erroneous perſons, go you Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, go you prophane wretches, go you Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors begon to hell, to the Devil and his Angels; now they ſhall be aſhamed and confounded for ever; So that God he hath his time ſooner or later to diſcover unſound hearted men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
               <p>Now that that I ſhall do here, ſhall be firſt to ſhew you who are like to prove unſound and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt hearted men and women. Secondly, to give you ſome Directions, or Arguments to prevent unſoundneſs of heart, ſhame and confuſion.</p>
               <p>Firſt, who are like to prove rotten and unſound at the heart.</p>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:94121:44"/>
               <p> Firſt, thoſe who do receive truth into impure hearts, into divided hearts; truth is holy, truth is pure, and truth never dwells or abides long but in a pure heart; tis true, truth doth ſojourn ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in a corrupt heart; <hi>Lot</hi> he ſojourns in <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> a little while; Chriſt lay a while in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, but he ſtaid not there long: and ſo mens corrupt wills thruſt out truth out of the heart, it will not let it ſtay long unleſs the heart be pure and holy, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.9. <hi>holding the myſterie of the faith in a pure Conſcience:</hi> That is, holding the Doctrine of the Goſpel, and a pure Conſcience; unleſs mens hearts and Conſciences be pure, they will never hold the myſterie; they may have ſome part of the myſterie conveyed unto them, which may viſit them a little while, but their hearts and Conſciences cannot hold the fame, and then ſuch men and women will prove unfound at the latter end.</p>
               <p>Secondly, They are like to prove unſound who do take upon them the profeſſion of Religion and Godlineſs, and do much, and go far, but not for right ends; many have their ends why they will profeſs Religion, why they will have a form of Godlineſs, and why they will do this and that; they have their ends why they will get into Church-fellowſhip; ſome will profeſs Religion and go far for credit, eſteem, and reſpect; when Religion is in faſhion, in credit and eſteem, they will be religious; ſo Scribes and Phariſes ſought honour of men; and ſo we have thoſe ſeek honour and credit of men, and becauſe of that they will enter upon Religion, but they will not be ſound; ſome do it for preferment and advantage; ſome
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:94121:44"/>again for livelyhood they are poor, mean and low in the world, and have heavy preſſures that way, and therefore they will get into a Church that they may be maintained, and ſo live by the ſweat of others, and think the Church is bound to maintain them and theirs; ſuch men as theſe will prove un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound at the laſt; but have you no better ends to move you then theſe to be Religious, and to look unto Gods Statutes? Let my heart be ſound in thy Statutes; the Glory of God muſt be your end, the good of Souls muſt be your end, the good of your own foul, and all other ends muſt be lay'd by; now if men have not ſuch ends as theſe, they will prove rotten at laſt, and will be diſcovered to their ſhame.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Thoſe are like to prove unſound at laſt and be aſhamed, who have not ſeriouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered what it may coſt them to profeſs the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, to be Chriſtians, to enter into Church ſtate, and are not reſolved to buy the Pearl, though it be at the deareſt rate, they will prove unſound; it may coſt you ſomething to be Chriſtians; ſo in <hi>Luke</hi> 14.26. and ſo forward; <hi>If any man come to me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>and hate not his Father, and Mother, and Wife, and Children, and Brethren, and Siſters, yea, and his own life;</hi> Mark, <hi>he cannot be my Diſciple; and whoſoever doth not bear his Croſs and come after me, cannot be my Diſciple; for which of you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to build a Tower, ſitteth not down firſt and counteth the coſt, whether he hath ſufficient to finiſh it; leaſt haply after he hath lay'd the Foundation, and is not able to finiſh it; all that behold him, begin to mock him; ſaying, this man began to build, and was not able to finiſh,</hi> &amp;c. if a man have not ſeriouſly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:94121:45"/>what it may coſt him to build up Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to build up his Soul, he will faint and not fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh; why? it may coſt him the hatred of Father and Mother, of Wife and Children, of Brethren and Siſters, yea loſs of life, it may coſt him all theſe; if he have not conſidered this, and caſt up what it may coſt him, this man will never finiſh; but give over, and give back when it comes to the tryal, therefore in <hi>v.</hi> 53. its ſaid, <hi>So likewiſe whoſoever he be of you, that forſaketh not all that he hath, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be my Diſciple.</hi> If a man do not ſit down and ſeriouſly weigh, it may coſt me all that I have: the Jews would not forſake the honour of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. <hi>How can ye believe that ſeek honour one of another?</hi> it may coſt you a right hand, a right eye, it may coſt you all your wiſdom and all your parts, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. <hi>Let him that thinketh himſelf wiſe, become a fool that he may be wiſe;</hi> Chriſt tells you in <hi>Math.</hi> 13. of the good Merchant: <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a Merchant-man ſeeking goodly Pearls, who when he had found one Pearl of great price, went and ſold all that he had, and bought it:</hi> he conſidered what a Pearl this was, a goodly Pearl, a rich Pearl, not ſuch a Pearl again in the world; well, is it ſuch a Pearl? I will part with all that I have for it: Now if men and women do not caſt aforehand what it may coſt them to be Chriſtians, a thouſand to one but they will let go Chriſt; the <hi>Gadarens</hi> let him go for their Swine, <hi>Judas</hi> let him go for thirty pieces of Silver: <hi>Buy the truth, and ſell it not:</hi> buy it whatſoever it coſt; when hard things come, and men have not conſidered how they are like to part with their livelyhoods, liberties and lives, they will bid farewel to Chriſt,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:94121:45"/>and farewel to the Goſpel, and farewel to Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and thus many have done in our dayes, and in former times: Such are like to prove unſound.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, They are like to prove unſound who do not mind the love of the truth, as well as truth it ſelf, and receive the love of the truth, 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.9.10. ſaith the Apoſtle there, <hi>becauſe they received not the love of the truth, that they might be ſaved.</hi> There are three things in every truth very conſiderable: there's the notion; there's the loving of truth, or love of truth; and there's the power. The <hi>notion</hi> reſpects the head, and that every man may have. The <hi>love</hi> reſpects the affections, and that few have. The <hi>Power</hi> reſpects the whole man, head, heart, and all, and that onely the Godly have: Now though men receive the notion of truth, (as the Devils may, and ſo wicked men) yet they may have unſound hearts; and if you have not the love, you will never have the power; and unleſs you have the love and the power, your hearts will be rotten and unſound for ever: Therefore ſee what's ſaid here; <hi>And for this cauſe God ſhall ſend them ſtrong Deluſions that they ſhould believe a lye, that they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleaſure in unrighteouſneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, That man or woman which doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive truth, and withhold truth in unrighteouſneſs; ſo that he doth not glorifie the God of truth, nor walk anſwerable unto truth, that man will be found unſound at the laſt, he will be diſcovered and made aſhamed: many receive truth, and then they impriſon it, as they did <hi>John;</hi> they ſhut him up in Priſon; and ſo many have truth but they Impriſon it; and if it makes a buſtle in their
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:94121:46"/>hearts, they put a gag into the mouth of truth, that it ſhall not ſpeak any further, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.21, 26. <hi>Becauſe that when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful: When they knew God;</hi> they had notions and truths, and received the knowledge of God; <hi>They did not glorifie God as God,</hi> but impriſoned thoſe truths; therefore, <hi>For this Cauſe God gave them up to vile affections;</hi> God left them now to the corruption of their own hearts; they were unſound, and were aſhamed and confounded at laſt: Therefore if truth comes in from a God of truth, and you do not glorifie that God of truth, nor walk anſwerable to the truth, fear unſoundneſs there: it's ſaid in <hi>Luke,</hi> that he that knew his Maſters will, and prepared not himſelf, neither did according to his will, ſhall be beaten with many ſtripes; if thou knoweſt thy Lord and Maſters will, he hath reveal'd his mind unto thee, and now thou doeſt not walk anſwerable to that, thou haſt an ill heart, thou haſt a corrupt Spirit, and thou ſhalt be made aſhamed; yea, thou ſhalt be <hi>beaten,</hi> and that with many ſtripes: do not many know they ſhould not prophane the Lords day, and yet will do it; they will be Drunk, Whore, Game, idle it abroad in the Fields; theſe men ſhall be beaten with many ſtripes. Many know they ſhould not wrong their Neighbors, nor oppreſs the poor, and grind the faces of them, but they will do it, theſe men are ill Servants, and the Lord will appear one day, and diſcover them, and beat them, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd grind them to powder; ſo that whereſoever truth comes and is impriſoned, and the God of truth is not glorified, nor men walk anſwerable,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:94121:46"/>there's rottenneſs of heart, and men will be aſhamed at the laſt.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Thoſe who are forward to cenſure and judge others when themſelves are guilty either of the ſame ſins, or of ſins equivalent and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable for their nature to the ſins of others, that they condemn, this argues unſoundneſs of heart, and will prove a ſhame unto thoſe perſons at the laſt; in <hi>Math.</hi> 7. <hi>Judge not that ye be not, Judged, for with what Judgment ye Judge ye ſhall be Judged, and with what meaſure ye meet, it ſhall be meaſured to you again, and why beholdeſt thou the mote that is in thy Brothers eye, but conſidereſt not the beam that is in thine own eye?</hi> haſt thou no beam? no mote? thou ſhouldeſt caſt out that; but now when a man hath a beam in his own eye, and ſees a mote in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that's evil: <hi>Or how wilt thou ſay to thy Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, let me pull out the moat out of thine eye, and behold a beam is in thine own eye? Thou Hypocrite,</hi> mark here's unſoundneſs, art thou a greater ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and condemneſt leſſer ſinners? Thou Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite; and <hi>woe to Scribes and to Hypocrites!</hi> in <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. beginning; <hi>Therefore thou art inexcuſeable, O man, whoſoever thou art that Judgeſt: For wherein thou Judgeſt another, thou condemneſt thy ſelf; for thou that Judgeſt doeſt the ſame things; But we are ſure that the Judgment of God is according to truth, againſt them that commit ſuch things:</hi> thou judgeſt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneſt another, and yet doeſt the ſame things; what if I condemn another for breaking Covenant with <hi>men,</hi> when I break Covenant with <hi>God</hi> my ſelf, am not I a <hi>greater</hi> ſinner? I do the ſame things, and the Judgment of God is according to truth, and God will Judge; take heed then of cenſuring
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:94121:47"/>others, of Judging and Condemning others leaſt you condemn your ſelves; you declare the rottenneſs of your hearts, and you will be found rotten at laſt.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, If men profeſs Religion, and be zealous towards God, and yet be without mercy, and without Juſtice; theſe men will be found un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound and rotten, and be aſhamed at laſt: There are many in theſe dayes are zealous, and will hear the word, and that's to be commended; but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, let them not reſt in the duties of the firſt Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but let them do the duties of the ſecond: In <hi>James</hi> 1. ſaith the Apoſtle there, <hi>If any man among you ſeemeth to be Religious, and bridleth not his Tongue, he deceiveth his own heart, and this mans Religion is in vain; pure Religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, to viſit the Fatherleſs and Widdows in their diſtreſs, and to keep himſelf-unſpotted in the world.</hi> To ſhew mercy, here's Religion; if I ſeem Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious and not be merciful, merciful to the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, to the Widdow, to the Orphan, to the Poor, to the Priſoner, my Religion is all vain: a dead Religion is like a dead Faith; and ſo for acts of Juſtice, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.10. <hi>In this the Children of God are manifeſted, and the Children of the Devil, whoſoever doth not righteouſneſs, is not of God.</hi> Who is he of then? he is of the Devil; 'tis not <hi>talking</hi> of Righteouſneſs, but <hi>doing</hi> Righteouſneſs, unleſs men and women will keep their promiſes, unleſs they will pay their Debts, unleſs they will pay their Servants wages, unleſs they will pay their Rents, unleſs they will pay what's borrowed, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they will reſtore what they have defrauded; what Religion is here? Heathens will deal juſtly
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:94121:47"/>and Righteouſly: And therefore thoſe that ſay they are Chriſtians, and not Righteous, they are of the Devil, and not of God.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, They have unſound hearts, and will be aſhamed, who take up Religion upon wrong grounds (I told you before upon baſe ends) and a multitude of people take up Religion upon wrong grounds; ſome take up Religion upon a State account, the countenance of a State; the State doth countenance Religion, and make Laws for Religion, and the like, and upon this account they take up Religion; thus was it in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s dayes; when he came, then many turned Proteſtants, who were Papiſts before; but when Queen <hi>Mary</hi> came in, and there was another face of things, then they turned Papiſts again: and in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s dayes, then they turned Proteſtants again: And thus many in theſe dayes, becauſe there is a ſtate Religion and Worſhip, they deſert their former principles and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions and fall in with what is preſent; ſuch men are unſound, and will be diſcovered one day to their ſhame: Many from the Cuſtomes of the places where they live, it's the Cuſtom of the Town, or of the place, it's the Cuſtom of the great ones to hear the word on the Lords day, or to Pray, and Read, and the like; and ſo upon this account they will become Religious; others upon the account of their forefathers, oru forefathers did ſo and ſo, and therefore they will do ſo; others upon the account of education, but theſe are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound grounds, and at one time or other ſuch men and women will be diſcovered to be rotten-hearted, and will be made aſhamed of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:94121:48"/>and therefore men and women ſhould look to the ground; Is it the command of God? and becauſe you find it's written in the book of God? Is it out of love to God, and glorifying of God, and ſaving of your Souls according to the will of God? unleſs it be thus, all your grounds are falſe and vain.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, They are like to prove unſound, and to be aſhamed who have their hearts ſoaked in the things of the world; who are ſtrongly carried out to them, and are taken up with theſe outward things, they are like to be aſhamed at one time or other; it's ſaid in <hi>James</hi> 4.4. <hi>Ye Adulterers and Adultereſſes, know ye not that the friendſhip of the world is enmity to God? whoſoever therefore will be a friend of the world is an enemy to God;</hi> tell me now whether any Adultereſſes, or Adulterers have a ſound heart; all thoſe that are friends to the world, and have their affections carried to the world, are they not enimies to God? are they not Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers? Men that are lovers of the pleaſures, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſits, honours and faſhions of this world, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound hearted, and will be diſcovered at one time or other, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.15. <hi>Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world, if any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him:</hi> and if that be not in him he is an unſound hearted man, and will be diſcovered one day to be ſo: <hi>Demas,</hi> he profeſſes Chriſtianity, he goes along with <hi>Paul,</hi> but becauſe the world was in his heart, he leaves <hi>Paul,</hi> and embraces the world; and <hi>Dorotheus</hi> an Eccleſiaſt cal Writer, he tells us that he went to <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> and there he turned an idolatrous Prieſt: <hi>Paul</hi> tells you plain enough, in the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:94121:48"/>1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.9, 10, <hi>They that will be rich;</hi> ſome men and women are reſolved to be rich: they <hi>will</hi> be rich in ſpight of all, they know it's but riſing early, and lying down late, and uſing their wits and their hands; But <hi>they that will be rich, fall into Temptations and a ſnare, and into many fooliſh and burtful luſts, which drown men in deſtruction and perdition; for the love of money is the root of all evil:</hi> is this heart ſound now? is that heart ſound that hath the root of all evil in it? look to it, thoſe that have their hearts ſoak'd in the world, and carried out to the things of the world, they are rotten; and ſo they will be diſcovered to be, one day to their ſhame <hi>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> therefore <hi>David</hi> ſaith, incline not my heart to covetouſneſs; O let not my heart go out to the world, leaſt I be aſhamed.</p>
               <p>Tenthly, Their hearts are unſound who have a ſecret diſlike of the wayes and things of God, and the ſtrictneſs of Religion: many men though they will not openly and outwardly ſpeak againſt the wayes of God, againſt ſtrictneſs and holineſs, exact and circumſpect walking; yet they have a ſecret diſlike of them, a ſecret ſlighting of them, and they do not approve of them, and think men may be too ſtrict; ſuch men their hearts are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound, and they will be diſcovered one day; ſaith he in <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. ye have ſaid it is in vain to ſerve God, and what profit is it that we have kept his Ordinances, and that we have walked mournfully before the Lord of Hoſts? They had ſlight thoughts of the wayes of God, and they were rotten and unſound (but there were others ſpake otherwiſe, &amp; they were Gods Jewels) &amp; they would not joyn with the wayes of God, but rather did withdraw
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:94121:49"/>from them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.25. <hi>Not forſaking the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of our ſelves, together as the manner of ſome is;</hi> we need not be ſo ſtrict, nor ſo oft in prayer, and hearing, and in ſpeaking of the things and wayes of God; the Commandements of God are grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous to them, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.3. when Gods Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements are grievous to a mans heart or ſpirit, it's a ſign he hath a ſick heart, a ſore heart, a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt rotten heart; when the Commands of God that would make them ſound, are grievous to them: Many care not for examining their own ſouls, when as the Scripture ſaith, <hi>prove your ſelves, examine your ſelves, know ye not your own ſelves that Chriſt is in you except ye be Reprobates, walk cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpectly, redeeming the time;</hi> ſuch men have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound hearts, and one day they will be diſcovered to their ſhame.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Thoſe that can walk up and down in the world, without having their thoughts carried un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, that can go all the day long and never think of God, or Heaven, or Eternity, or Chriſt; theſe men have unſound hearts, in <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.17. ſaith the wiſe man there, <hi>Let not thy heart envy ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, but be thou in the fear of the Lord all the day long:</hi> A man ſhould have God in his thoughts all the day long, and ſhould be fearing God from morning to evening, and ſanctifie God in his heart, and make him his dread and his fear: whereſoever he goes, a man ſhould be afraid to diſpleaſe God, in any place, in any Company, at any time; but now when a man goes up and down all the day long, and never thinks of God, nor fears God, this man is rotten at the heart, he hath an unſound heart, for he cares not for God, nor for his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany;

                  <hi>depart from us,</hi> ſay they in <hi>Job,</hi> we care not for thy company: So though this man ſaith it not with his Tongue, yet he ſaith it with his heart; <hi>The fear of the Lord is a fountain of life to depart from the ſnares of death:</hi> how can you depart from the ſnares of death, when you are not in the fear of God? Some fear God in time of Thunder, or in a common Plague; but to live in the fear of God all the day, all their lives, they know not what it means; theſe have unſound hearts and will be aſhamed.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Whoſoever doth preſume upon the merits of Chriſt, and the mercies of God, and walk looſely, they are unſound hearted, and ſhall one day be aſhamed; 'tis a common thing in theſe dayes for Chriſtians to preſume upon Chriſt's merits, why did not Chriſt dye for ſinners? is not God merciful? yes, but muſt you walk looſely now? Chriſt did not dye for ſinners that they might go and ſin, neither is God merciful to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage you to ſin; but you will find Chriſt a Stone to grind you to powder, and Gods mercy to be fury and vengeance to you that do ſo; in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. <hi>There is therefore now, no Condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus, which walk not after the fleſh,</hi> (mark) <hi>but after the Spirit:</hi> If men do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume upon Chriſts merits, and Gods mercies, and ſay they have a part in God and Chriſt, they muſt not walk after the fleſh; but if you walk looſely, you walk after the fleſh; what, Drink, Swear, Whore, Lye, Cheat, Rail, Slander, Backbite, Defraud, and Couzen in Bargaining and Selling? you walk after the fleſh, you have no intereſt in Chriſts merits, there's condemnation and nothing

They are unſound hearted who do account themſelves rich, ſtrong, wiſe, knowing, and full, thoſe that are conceited of their own worth, of their own excellency, of their own ability; and as they have unſound hearts, ſo they will be diſcovered one day for rotten hearted men and women. It is incident to you all to have too high thoughts of your ſelves. <hi>Paul</hi> tells you in <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.2. <hi>If a man thinks himſelf ſome body when he is nothing, he deceives himſelf;</hi> why ſhould the Apoſtle lay down this Rule, but that it was the practice of the Chriſtians then? theſe <hi>Galatians</hi> thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves wiſer than <hi>Paul,</hi> they muſt have another Goſpel, they muſt go another way to Heaven, we will not be tyed to theſe wayes; they thought themſelves ſome bodies, when they were nothing, and ſo deceived their own ſouls; <hi>O fooliſh</hi> Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians! they were fools indeed: And the Church of <hi>Laodicea</hi> is a pregnant inſtance for you all to take notice of; ſhe ſaid ſhe was rich, full, and wanted nothing; here was a Church had Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, Ordinances, Enjoyments, Apoſtolical

Chriſt tells thee, without me ye can do nothing, nothing to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, nothing to pleaſe God, nothing to afford you comfort or peace, nothing to further your ſalvation without Chriſt; the Apoſtle tells you, <hi>We are not ſufficient;</hi> I <hi>Paul</hi> am not ſufficient to think a good thought; well, ſee the Rule, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.17. <hi>Whatſoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jeſus;</hi> don't do it in your own name, you are unſound, if you do; your principles are not right, your knowledge is not right and ſound; but whatſoever ye do, do all in the name of Chriſt: what Chriſtians, and do any thing in any name but in the name of Chriſt? you are baſe Chriſtians, and you ſhould do all in the ſtrength of Chriſt, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1. <hi>My Son,</hi> he ſpeaks to <hi>Timothy</hi> an Evangeliſt, a man full of grace and of the ſpirit; <hi>My Son be thou ſtrong through the grace that is in Chriſt;</hi> ſaith <hi>David, I will go forth in the

<pb n="95" facs="tcp:94121:51"/>hearted, and undid themſelves; for when men or women bring any thing to Chriſt, they undo themſelves; you muſt come without money to Chriſt, without righteouſneſs, without your duties, without your own actions and the good of them; for what's all your goodneſs but as a morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cloud? therefore whoſoever will bring ought to Chriſt is unſound and will be aſhamed: and ſo are you if you fetch your comfort from any but Chriſt; there are many poor Chriſtians which are ſhaken very much, &amp; are empty of all is good in their own eyes, yet they will fetch their Comfort from elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where than from Chriſt; they will fetch their comfort from the promiſes, from God immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, or from the Ordinances, or the Miniſter, or ſome good Chriſtian, or Godly friend; but know that if you fetch your comfort any where but from Chriſt, it will never hold; is not Chriſt the conſolation of <hi>Iſrael?</hi> God hath given Chriſt to ſend the Comforter, and you muſt have your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in Chriſt; for all the promiſes of God in Chriſt are yea, and in him, <hi>Amen;</hi> the promiſes are made firſt to Chriſt, and you muſt take up the promiſe in Chriſt, and draw the comfort out of the promiſe through Chriſt, and you muſt go to God through Chriſt; what comfort to you from God out of Chriſt? it's nothing but diſcomfort; if we will take up comfort any way but by Chriſt, we go the wrong way to work, and undo our ſelves, and ſhall be aſhamed at laſt.</p>

God muſt have thy ſtrength: Love the Lord thy God will all thy ſtrength, but if we love any thing more than God, where are we then? 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. <hi>Lovers of pleaſure more than Lovers of God;</hi> men will ſpend night and day in Feaſting, in Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in Gaming, in Rioting, one way or other,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:94121:53"/>what are theſe now but corrupt men, unſound men, rotten hearted men, men that will be aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one day? ſo then as Chriſt ſaith to <hi>Peter;</hi> Let me ſay to you, Peter, <hi>Loveſt thou me more then theſe? why Lord thou knoweſt,</hi> thou knouweſt I love thee more; ſo do you love God and Chriſt more than the world and things of it? can you ſay, Lord thou knoweſt I love thee more than them? Do you love Chriſt and God more than Wives and Children; he that don't hate Father and Mother, Wife and Children, in reſpect of God and Chriſt, is not worthy of God and Chriſt, though God don't require you to hate them, but when they come in competition; do you love God and Chriſt more than your luſts, or eſtate, or limbs or lives, they loved not their lives unto the death in the 12 <hi>Rev.</hi> if you love God and Chriſt more than theſe, happy are you; you are ſound hearted in truth, then God will ſay, here's a man or woman that loves me with all their heart, with all their ſoul, with all their mind, with all their ſtrength, and I will love them, and do for them anſwerably; Thus you may ſee there are a great many who think themſelves ſound hearted, who are like to prove unſound at the laſt, and ſo will be aſhamed. Now to the uſes of the point.</p>
               <p>Firſt, here we are informed that men of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound hearts ſhall not alwayes lye hid: They may cover up their unſoundneſs and keep it from the eyes of men a while, but not alwayes. They may do by their hearts, as by their bodies; many have unſound limbs, they have untoward diſeaſes, and they cover them up, and hide them from the world, but at laſt they come to be known, and to
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:94121:53"/>be diſcovered; <hi>Job</hi> tells you what the Lord will do in his 12 Chapter. <hi>Time</hi> diſcovers ſome; ſee what the times have done in our dayes, it hath diſcovered many, the rottenneſs of their hearts and principles: <hi>Afflictions</hi> are diſcovering things and diſcover ſome; when afflictions come, then unſound ones are diſcovered; when <hi>perſecution</hi> and <hi>temptation</hi> come, then the ſtony ground was diſcovered; <hi>Death</hi> diſcovers ſome, then they ſee their hearts and hopes are rotten, and that they have been deceived; and God will diſcover all; <hi>Job</hi> 12.21.22. <hi>he poureth Contempt upon Princes, and weakneth the ſtrength of the mighty; he diſcovereth deep things out of darkneſs, and bringeth forth to light the ſhaddow of death;</hi> there's deep rottenneſs lyes in darkneſs, in mens hearts, they have corrupt principles, they have divided hearts, they have baſe luſts, they are Hypocrites, they pretend one thing and intend another; men have the world in their hearts, hell in their hearts, blood in their hearts, revenge in their hearts, and all baſeneſs in their hearts, and yet have a form of Religion, God will diſcover them, and they ſhall not alwayes lye hid.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If unſound hearts ſhall at one time or other be made known, then don't envy men of unſound hearts, whatſoever their outward happineſs be; ſome are very envious when they ſee men to have great eſtates, honours, and great attendance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and that their paths are buttered, and their feet dip'd in Oyl, they are troubled at it; but if they be men of unſound principles, that have a divided heart, men that have a form of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and not the power, men that are rotten and
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:94121:54"/>do not walk with God in the world; do not envy them; what if a man have rich cloaths upon his body when he hath a rotten body; many have the Plague or the Pox, and what if they go in Silks, Sattins, &amp; Velvets? do not envy them: what if a man have a bountiful body, &amp; yet have ulcerated lungs? what if a man have <hi>Dives</hi> fare, <hi>Dives</hi> apparel, and <hi>Dives</hi> heart within? don't envy him: Their unſoundneſs will be diſcovered, and then you will ſay, you would not be in their condition for all the world.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If unſound hearted men and women ſhall be diſcovered, then let unſound hearted men expect their portion, look for ſhame; haſt thou an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound heart? is thy heart divided between Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth? art thou a man that haſt a ſick ſoul through luſt and ſin? haſt thou ſeeming graces, and not real graces? art thou an Hypocrite? doſt thou profeſs and not practice? look for thy portion; <hi>ſhame</hi> will be thy portion; time is coming thou wilt be found what thou art not: thou appeareſt a <hi>Saint,</hi> thou wilt be found an <hi>Hypocrite;</hi> thou ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareſt a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> thou wilt be found to be an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy to Chriſt and God, thou wilt be found to be reprobate Silver; in <hi>Jer.</hi> 6. <hi>Reprobate Silver ſhall men call them, becauſe the Lord hath rejected them:</hi> you Jews, of all the Nations in the world, you went for Silver, you had the Oracles, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, the Services, the Temple, and the worſhip of God, but ſaith the Lord, I have found you reprobate Silver; I have found you to be droſs, and I have reprobated you; and you are reprobate Silver; and ſo in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22.18. <hi>Son of man, the houſe of Iſrael is to me become droſs, all they are Braſs, and Tin, and Iron, and Lead in the middeſt of the Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:94121:54"/>they are even the droſs of Silver,</hi> the houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> is become droſs unto me, I look'd they ſhould have been ſound hearted, but they are droſs, Iron, Tin, Lead, and Braſs; O that the <hi>houſe of Iſrael</hi> ſhould be droſs! is not the houſe of <hi>England</hi> ſo? and the people of this place ſo? if the Lord ſhould ſearch you, what ſoundneſs, what ſincerity is in you? what new creatures are you? are you regenerate? have you Chriſt in you, as well as the name of Chriſt upon you? I am afraid leaſt you ſhould prove Droſs, Tin, Braſs, Lead, and the droſs of Silver; even reprobate Silver: let all them that are unſound hearted look for their portion, even ſhame; you will be diſappointed of your expectations, you will meet with that you did not look for; ſee what the Lord ſaith of thoſe are <hi>right,</hi> in <hi>Luke</hi> 21. <hi>When theſe things begin to come to paſs, lift up your heads and rejoyce, for your Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion draweth nigh;</hi> when terrors come, and when the world ſhall be even in a confuſion, and in a flame, then do you lift up your heads, you ſhall not be aſhamed; but all that are unſound hearted, will hang down their heads, and cry to mountains, O cover us, and fall upon us, becauſe of the wrath of the Lamb, O he is come and will diſcover us; Chriſt knows the heart and the reins, and ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches them, as in <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. and will render to every man according to what he finds; are you rotten? you ſhall be aſhamed, and I will render to you according to what you are, but I will ſay to the ſheep that are ſound, <hi>come ye bleſſed;</hi> and I will ſay to others, <hi>go ye curſed, Math.</hi> 25. The wiſe Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins they come, and they are called to come to enter to take the Kingdom; but the fooliſh Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:94121:55"/>are ſhut out; go ye curſed into everlaſting fire: they met with that they look'd not for; here's the condition of unſound hearted men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; oh how ſad then is the condition of unſound hearted men?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Look to your hearts, look to your ſpirits, that you be ſound hearted, and ſo may not be aſhamed.</p>
               <p>What ſhall we do? I have told you before how to get ſoundneſs of heart, and how to keep it, and preſs'd it with arguments; I ſhall add a little.</p>
               <p>Firſt, if you would neither be unſound hearted, nor aſhamed at any time; labour to get God to be your Father, and to be in Gods houſe and in Gods way, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54. <hi>And all thy Children ſhall be taught of the Lord, and great ſhall be the peace of thy Children:</hi> if God be your Father, and you be his Children, he will teach you, and he will teach you that which ſhall make your hearts ſound. <hi>All thy Children,</hi> whoſe <hi>Children?</hi> the Children of <hi>Sion;</hi> the Church is Gods houſe, all that get into <hi>Sion</hi> are in Gods houſe, are in Gods way, they ſhall be taught of God, and great ſhall be their peace; ſuch a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſuch a Father, will Inſtill good Doctrine into you, make you ſound hearted, and train you up in the nurture of the Lord, and in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 48.17. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, the holy one of Iſrael, I am the Lord thy God which teacheth thee to profit, and lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thee in the way that thou ſhouldeſt go;</hi> but now if it be not ſo, you muſt wander, you ſhall go in by wayes, you will have an unſound heart, and periſh for ever.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if you would have hearts neither un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound, nor ſuch as ſhall make you aſhamed at the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:94121:55"/>laſt day, keep your hearts humble and low in the ſight of God, <hi>be whoſe heart is lifted up in him, is not right,</hi> as <hi>Habbak.</hi> 2.4. his ſoul is not ſound; keep your hearts humble and low through the ſenſe of your own emptyneſs, nothingneſs, guilt, wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed deſerving, the account you muſt give to God, &amp; danger of miſcarriage, and in the 25 <hi>Pſal.</hi> ſaith <hi>David, The meek will he guide in Judgment, and the meek will he teach his way;</hi> God loves humble, and low, and meek ſpirits; and <hi>v.</hi> 12. <hi>What man is he that feareth the Lord? him ſhall he teach in the way that he ſhall chooſe.</hi> No man fears God that is proud, and lifted up; no man that is humble and meek, but fears God, and God will teach that man, and keep him, that he ſhall never be aſhamed.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If you would not have unſound hearts, nor be aſhamed, then let me intreat you to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the whole word of God into your hearts; receive the <hi>whole truth,</hi> and <hi>with love,</hi> and <hi>as the truth of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, receive the whole truth, for if you be partial, and will receive ſome truth and not all, you ſhew your hearts to be unſound, and you will be aſhamed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.6. <hi>Then ſhall I not be aſhamed when I have reſpect unto all thy Commandements:</hi> what if <hi>David</hi> ſhould have reſpect to all but one? he would be aſhamed and confounded, if he ſhould not have reſpect unto all; he that breaks one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, ſaith <hi>James,</hi> is guilty of all.</p>
               <p>Secondly, receive all with love, and unleſs you do ſo, all is nothing; receive the truths of God becauſe they are holy truths, becauſe they have the ſtamp of God upon them, becauſe they will bring you to God and Glory.</p>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:94121:56"/>
               <p> Thirdly, receive them as the truths of God, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.13. <hi>For this cauſe alſo thank we God without ceaſing, becauſe when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of Men:</hi> Mark, many ſay the word of the Apoſtles and Miniſters is the word of men, and they will not receive it nor hear it; but mark, <hi>you received it as it is in truth the word of God, which effectually worketh in you that believe.</hi> The word is the word of God, let them ſay what they will, and it works, and works effectually in them that receive it ſo: Therefore receive the whole word, receive it with love, receive it as the word of God and not as the word of men.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Laſtly, if you would be neither un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound hearted, nor aſhamed in time of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, in an hour of Death, in the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; make the Lord Jeſus Chriſt your friend: whoſoever hath Chriſt for a friend ſhall never be aſhamed; but if Chriſt be not your friend, let whoſe will plead for you, you will be aſhamed, you muſt be confounded, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.1. <hi>If any man ſin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the Righteous;</hi> it is as if the Apoſtle had ſaid we do know Chriſt, and we have union with Chriſt, and intereſt in Chriſt, and Chriſt is our Friend, and our Advocate, and he will plead our cauſe; though Devils accuſe, and Conſcience accuſe, yet Chriſt will keep us from ſhame; ſee then that you get the Lord Chriſt to be your friend; how is that? how? give up your ſelves wholly to him: Let your underſtandings con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of his worth and excellency, that he hath all fullneſs in him, that he is the Mediator, that he
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:94121:56"/>is the Prince of life, that he is the great recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciler of man to God the father, and that Chriſt invites men to come to himſelf, in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. <hi>Hoe every one that thirſteth,</hi> (it's Chriſts invitation) <hi>Come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money; come ye, buy and eat, yea, come, buy wine and milk, without money and without price:</hi> put forth an act of Faith in me, cloſe with me; chooſe me for your Husband, for your Portion, for your Righteouſneſs, for your ſatisfaction; chooſe me for your Advocate and ſurety; chooſe me to be your friend, ſaith Chriſt, and ſuch a friend is worth the having, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.15. <hi>Henceforth I call you not Servants, for the Servant knoweth not what his Lord doth, but I have called you friends:</hi> If you chooſe Chriſt to be your friend, he will own you, and call you friends; therefore receive all that Chriſt hath given out, <hi>I have told you all that I have heard of my Father:</hi> Therefore whatſoever Chriſt hath made known from the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to you, receive it, embrace it, obey it, practice it; teſtifie love and friendſhip to Chriſt, and then he will teſtifie love and friendſhip to you; but if you will not do this, in <hi>Luk.</hi> 9.26. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall be aſhamed of me, and of my word, of him ſhall the Son of man be aſhamed, when he ſhall come in his own Glory, and in his Fathers, and of the holy Angels.</hi> And then confuſion ſhall be upon you to all Eternity.</p>
               <p>The Lord teach you all to mind theſe things, and to remember the Text, and make uſe of that, and pray it over once a day at leaſt to the Lord, Lord let my heart be found in thy Statutes, that I be not aſhamed: If the heart be not ſound, you will be aſhamed to all eternity.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>IN the Verſe before, the Apoſtle tells us the great intereſt that the Saints have in God, and the ground of it.</p>
            <p>Their great intereſt in God is this, that <hi>whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they ask, they receive of him;</hi> they have ſuch intereſt that God grants their Prayers whatever they ask.</p>

            <p>The Apoſtle tells you in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.5. <hi>The end of the Commandement is charity, out of a Pure heart, and of a good Conſcience, and of faith unfeigned.</hi> If <hi>love</hi> dont come from <hi>faith unfeigned,</hi> it is not ſpiritual love.</p>
            <p>In the words read, you have</p>
            <p>Firſt, the Commander, in the word <hi>his.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, The thing commanded, <hi>Believing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, The object or perſon in whom they are to believe, or we are to believe, ſet out:</p>
            <p>Firſt, by his Relation, <hi>the Son of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, by his Titles, <hi>Jeſus</hi> and <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Commander here is <hi>God,</hi> there is none greater than he, and therefore his Commands are of greateſt authority; if in the word of a <hi>King</hi> there be <hi>power,</hi> how much more in the word of the <hi>great and high God?</hi> and 'tis not a <hi>verbal</hi> Command onely, but 'tis a <hi>written</hi> Command, that all may take notice of it, and may yield obedience unto it. The point that I ſhall commend unto you is this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> That believing in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, is a duty under Command.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Mark</hi> 1.15. ſaith he, Repent ye, and <hi>believe the Goſpel. Repentance</hi> is commanded, and <hi>believing the Goſpel</hi> is commanded; and a man cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Goſpel, unleſs he believe in the Son of God. I ſhall not multiply Scriptures to prove it, the Text is enough, <hi>This is his command, that we believe in his Son Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I ſhall in the proſecution of this point, ſhew you what is imployed in <hi>Believing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:94121:58"/> 2. What's meant by the <hi>Name</hi> of the Son of God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. What <hi>believing in the name of the Son of God</hi> doth alſo imply.</p>
            <p>And then anſwer ſome queſtions, and improve the point.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, what is implyed in <hi>believing?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Knowledge</hi> is implyed in it: 'tis a blind faith where there is no knowledge, the Papiſts believe as the Church believes, and ſuch a faith is a fancy rather than true faith, <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>I know</hi> in whom I have believed, and in <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.3. <hi>knowledge</hi> there is put for <hi>faith,</hi> ſo eſſential is it to faith, that it is put for faith it ſelf, this is life eternal, that they might <hi>know thee</hi> the onely true God. So that in <hi>believing</hi> there muſt be <hi>knowledge,</hi> and underſtanding, elſe it will be a blind believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, a blind faith.</p>
            <p>Secondly, In believing there is implyed <hi>aſſent of the underſtanding</hi> to the <hi>truth</hi> that is propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, truth is the object of the underſtanding; As, <hi>Chriſt came into the World to ſave ſinners,</hi> I muſt aſſent unto this truth; <hi>God is in Chriſt reconciling the world unto himſelf.</hi> Such truths and Propoſitions as theſe there muſt be the aſſent of the underſtanding unto; and Papiſts will go thus far in the point of faith, and make the very formal nature of faith to lye in aſſent; 'tis a truth, there muſt be aſſent, but aſſent is not enough: They place it altogether in the underſtanding; and fix it there; but <hi>the Devils believe and tremble,</hi> and give aſſent unto truths; they ſaid Chriſt was the Son of God, they gave aſſent, yea the Devils believe and tremble; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this is not enough, though this is required
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:94121:58"/>and neceſſary; aſſent there muſt be, but there muſt be more than aſſent. But,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, There muſt be <hi>Conſent,</hi> which brings in the heart and will, and looks at the <hi>goodneſs</hi> of the truth or perſon; ſome good that is in any truth propounded, or any perſon to be believed in <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.9, 10. <hi>If thou confeſs with thy mouth the Lord Jeſus, and ſhalt believe in thine heart;</hi> Not in thine <hi>head,</hi> for with the <hi>heart</hi> man believeth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Righteouſneſs; with the <hi>heart</hi> man believes: there muſt be the <hi>heart</hi> in believing, and not the head and underſtanding onely; ſo that there muſt be conſent of the will and heart unto the thing believed.</p>
            <p>Now this conſent muſt be <hi>free,</hi> and <hi>full,</hi> to have Chriſt, and whole Chriſt; to have Chriſt at the <hi>beſt,</hi> and have Chriſt at the <hi>worſt,</hi> whatever may fall out in true believing; there is ſuch a free and full conſent, that it will have Chriſt whatever it coſt.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Laſtly, in believing, there muſt be <hi>affiance,</hi> a confidence or truſt, and that you will find expreſs'd in <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.12. that we ſhould be to the praiſe of his glory, who firſt <hi>truſted</hi> in Chriſt, there muſt be truſting. After we <hi>know,</hi> and give <hi>aſſent</hi> and <hi>conſent,</hi> then we muſt <hi>truſt,</hi> and <hi>depend,</hi> and <hi>rely</hi> upon Chriſt. So in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12. I know whom I have <hi>believed;</hi> in your margin it is whom I have <hi>truſted;</hi> ſo that there is a truſt, a confidence, a relyance, a recumbency, a dependance upon the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, where there is a right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving: Thus you ſee what is implyed in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving.</p>
            <pb n="110" facs="tcp:94121:59"/>
            <p> Secondly, What's meant by the name of Jeſus Chriſt?</p>
            <p>Not the Letters, or Syllables, as many bow at the name of Jeſus; that is not the meaning, but <hi>Name</hi> is put for the <hi>Thing,</hi> or put for the perſon; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.3. Let us exalt his <hi>Name</hi> together; that is, <hi>God himſelf,</hi> let us exalt God himſelf; ſo, thou ſhalt reverence that dreadful name <hi>Jehovah,</hi> that's God himſelf; and when you read of <hi>Sanctifying the name of God</hi> in Scripture, that is, God himſelf. And ſo here, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.13. you will find <hi>by Name</hi> is meant God himſelf; whoſoever ſhall call upon the <hi>Name</hi> of the Lord ſhall be ſaved; that is, ſhall call upon God himſelf. And <hi>Acts</hi> 4.12. There is none other <hi>Name</hi> under Heaven given among men, whereby we muſt be ſaved; that is, there is no perſon but Jeſus whereby you can be ſaved. And <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.18. he that believeth <hi>on him</hi> is not Condemned, but he that believeth not is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned already, becauſe he hath not believed in the <hi>Name</hi> of the onely begotten Son of God.</p>
            <p>Now what is it to believe in his name; or in him?</p>
            <p>Firſt, it implyes the receiving into our heads and hearts all things God hath revealed from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven concerning him.</p>
            <p>As, that he is the Son of God, that God gave him for our good, that God ſent him to be bread and water of Life unto us, that we might live through him, God ſent him to be our Mediator, our Saviour, our Redeemer (and the like) we are to receive theſe truths that God hath revealed concerning Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <pb n="111" facs="tcp:94121:59"/>
            <p> Secondly, It is to take Chriſt for the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and building, and top ſtone of our Salvation, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.11. <hi>Other foundations can no man lay, then that is lay'd, which is Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> To take the Lord Chriſt to be our <hi>Prophet,</hi> to be our <hi>King,</hi> to be our <hi>High Prieſt,</hi> to be all in all unto us.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It is to rely upon him, and truſt in him, for the removal of all our ſins, ſupply of all our wants, and inveſtment of us in his own Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs; this is to believe in the Name, or in the Son, and to depend upon him for Redemption, for Sanctification, for Reconciliation, for Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for Salvation: So then you ſee the point is, that believing lyes under a command, this is his Commandement, that we ſhould believe on the Name of his Son Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now come to ſome queſtions, and the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> Firſt is, Have we power to believe? can any do it? may they not as eaſily keep the Law as believe on the Son of God? is there any power in us to do it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An.</hi> You know that there are in the world di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſorts of people that do acknowledge power in us to do it.</p>
            <p>But know, that man ſimply conſidered in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, hath no power to believe in the Son of God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. we are not ſufficient of our ſelves to think a good thought, but all our ſufficiency is from him; if we ben't ſufficient of our ſelves to <hi>think</hi> any thing of our ſelves as good, but our ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency is of God; ſurely we cannot <hi>believe</hi> then, which is ſo great a work, and glorious a work: and in <hi>Col.</hi> 2.12. <hi>Faith</hi> is ſaid to be the opperation of God, not of Man.</p>
            <pb n="112" facs="tcp:94121:60"/>
            <p> But for the further clearing of the point, know,</p>
            <p>Firſt, that as God commandeth us to believe, ſo he hath promiſed to give us faith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.21. it's ſaid, <hi>in him ſhall the Gentiles truſt,</hi> here is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe made to us that are Gentiles, that we ſhall truſt in the name of Chriſt; God will work that power in them that they ſhall truſt in Chriſt, and believe in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.37. all that the father giveth me <hi>ſhall come to me,</hi> here's a promiſe, they ſhall come, that is, they ſhall believe, And faith is called the gift of God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.8. By grace are ye ſaved, through <hi>faith,</hi> and that not of our ſelves, it is the <hi>gift of God.</hi> None but God can give Chriſt, and none but God can give power to believe in Chriſt. As faith is the Command of God, ſo faith is likewiſe the work of God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.29. This is the work of God that ye believe on him whom he hath ſent; that's the firſt anſwer.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Lord giveth the means whereby it is wrought, namely the Goſpel: The Goſpel is the means whereby faith is wrought, which he hath appointed and ordained for that very pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and therefore the Goſpel is called faith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.23. ſpeaking of <hi>Paul,</hi> that he which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted us in times paſt, now <hi>preacheth the faith,</hi> which once he deſtroyed, preacheth the <hi>faith,</hi> that is, the Goſpel which works faith, and is the means that God uſes to work faith in the Souls of Men and Women. The brazen Serpent was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of God, to cure the ſtingings of the fiery Serpent, no other Serpent would do it, nor no other means would do it, if they had uſed all the Phyſitians in the world they could not have done
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:94121:60"/>it, but the brazen Serpent which God had appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. So no other word will work it but the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, which he hath appointed to work faith; and therefore the Apoſtle tells you that <hi>faith comes by hearing,</hi> hearing of the Goſpel which is appointed by God for that very end.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Lord he doth accompany his word with his ſpirit to make it effectual; the word without the ſpirit would not be effectual, and therefore God doth accompany his word with his ſpirit, that it may be effectual to work faith in the hearts of Men and Women. Hence it is that the <hi>ſpirit</hi> is called the <hi>ſpirit of faith,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.13. We having, faith the Apoſtle, the ſame <hi>ſpirit of faith;</hi> it's called the <hi>ſpirit of faith,</hi> becauſe by the Goſpel it doth work faith in the hearts of Merrand Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; and <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.2. This would I know of you ſaith the Apoſtle, received you the ſpirit by the works of the Law, or by the hearing of <hi>Faith?</hi> why, you heard the Doctrine of Faith, the Goſpel, and by the hearing of Faith you received the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: for the Goſpel is the Miniſtration of the ſpirit, and the Chariot of the ſpirit; and ſo God doth by the Goſpel convey the ſpirit into the hearts of men and women, and by the ſpirit works faith in their Souls.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The Lord commands things that are hard for us, yea impoſſible unto us, that ſo we may ſeek to him, to whom nothing is impoſſible, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.37. for with God nothing ſhall be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, no word is impoſſible to God, whatever he hath ſaid he is able to make it good; and you know in the Goſpel that blind <hi>Bartemeus,</hi> he ſeeks unto Chriſt for the Cure of his eyes: The blind
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:94121:61"/>man in <hi>Joh.</hi> 9. that was born blind, his eyes were opened; ſo we that were born blind, and born dead, ſtill-born, without grace, without faith, without ſpiritual life, the Lord commands us to believe, that we may look to him to convey life, and work grace and faith in our ſouls. But,</p>
            <p>Fifthly, There is in the Goſpel the offer of Chriſt to ſinners, you ſhall ſee it clear in 13 <hi>Acts,</hi> that the offer of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, is offered in the Goſpel, and tendered unto ſinners, <hi>v.</hi> 26. Men and Brethren, Children of the Stock of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and whoſoever among you feareth God, to you is the word of this ſalvation ſent, to you it's ſent, and <hi>v.</hi> 38. Be it known unto you therefore, Men and Brethren, that through this man is Preached unto you the forgiveneſs of ſins, and in the 46. and 47. verſes, <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> waxed bold, and ſaid, it was neceſſary that the word of God ſhould firſt have been ſpoken to you; but ſeeing ye put it from you, and Judge your ſelves unworthy of everlaſting life, loe, we turn to the Gentiles; For ſo hath the Lord commanded us, ſaying, I have ſet thee to be a light to the Gentiles; ſo that Chriſt, and ſalvation, and all ſpiritual mercies, are offered and tendered in the Goſpel unto us, unto us Gentiles, unto us Sinners. And ſurely ſuch an offer is worthy of acceptation.</p>
            <p>This very offer hath ſome efficacy and virtue in it to ſtir up ſouls to receive Chriſt, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. <hi>This is a faithful ſaying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Jeſus Chriſt came into the world to ſave Sinners:</hi> O 'tis a faithful ſaying, and it's worthy of all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation whatſoever, that Jeſus Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſinners: will not every poor
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:94121:61"/>creature ſay, why ſhould not I accept of Chriſt, and cloſe with Chriſt now, ſeeing he is offered unto me?</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Laſtly, you know there are choice promiſes in the Goſpel, and theſe promiſes are load-ſtones to draw our Iron hearts to Chriſts <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. God ſo loved the world, that he gave his onely begotten Son, that <hi>whoſoever</hi> believeth in him ſhould not periſh but have everlaſting life. O what a load-ſtone is here to a poor ſinner? I am like to periſh, and to dye, but God hath ſo loved the world that he gave his onely begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life. So in <hi>Acts</hi> 10.43. <hi>To him give all the Prophets witneſs, that through his Name, whoſoever believeth in him ſhall receive remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſins.</hi> Here's another ſweet promiſe, that they ſhall receive remiſſion of their ſins whatever they be, that believe in him; ſo that the promiſes are load-ſtones to draw us to Chriſt. And ſo much for anſwer to that Queſtion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Another queſtion is this; Doth believing lye under a command? and is faith ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary as that it muſt lye under a command? it ſeems there's a great neceſſity of believing, is there ſuch a neceſſity of believing?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yes, 'tis not an Arbitrary thing, an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent thing, whether ye will believe, yea or no. But in four or five particulars, I ſhall ſhew you that there is a neceſſity of believing.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. Before you have ſaith you are evil Trees, you are evil perſons; but when by ſaith we are engrafted into Chriſt, then out fruit
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:94121:62"/>will be good fruit, and we ſhall be good trees. Now if there be a neceſſity of pleaſing God, then there will be a neceſſity of believing.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Is there any neceſſity you ſhould be Children of God? without faith you cannot be Children of God, you may be Children of nature, you may be Children of diſobedience, Children of darkneſs, Children of wrath, Children of death, but you cannot be Children of God without faith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.26. <hi>For ye are all the Children of God by faith in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> If you han't faith in Jeſus Chriſt, you are not, you cannot be Children of God, and it's a ſad thing not to be a Child of God; if there be a neceſſity then to be a Child of God, there is a neceſſity of faith.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Is there a neceſſity of having your ſins forgiven you, would you not have your ſins for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given you? yes ſurely, every man and woman, would have their ſins forgiven them, but without faith you cannot have your ſins forgiven, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. <hi>whom God hath ſet forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his Righteouſneſs for the Remiſſion of ſins.</hi> There muſt be <hi>Faith</hi> in the blood of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, if ever you would have the remiſſion of your ſins; there's no forgiveneſs without faith; <hi>without ſhedding of blood there is no remiſſion,</hi> without faith in that blood ſhed you will never have remiſſion, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.24. <hi>I ſaid therefore unto you, that ye ſhall dye in your ſins; for if ye believe not that I am he, ye ſhall dye in your ſins;</hi> If perſons have not faith in the perſon of the L. Jeſus Chriſt, they muſt dye in their ſins, and have no remiſſion of them; therefore as there is a neceſſity of having our ſins forgiven, ſo there is a neceſſity of believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <pb n="117" facs="tcp:94121:62"/>
            <p> You can never have any ſetled and ſolid com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort unleſs you have faith in the blood and death of Jeſus-Chriſt, your comforts will be unſetled; why? your ſins are not forgiven, &amp; if you have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rehenſions, your ſins are not forgiven, where's your comfort? where's your peace? where's any ſettled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſpirit? it can never be; and that's the thing that ſhakes moſt Profeſſors, becauſe they are upon uncertainties, about the forgiveneſs of their ſins.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, you can never come to God as a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without faith in the Son, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.6. <hi>I am the way, the truth, and the life, no man comes to the Father but by me:</hi> that is, by faith in me, by ſaith in me the mediator, by faith in me the Son of God, by faith in me that am Jeſus, by faith in me that am Chriſt, no coming to the Father but by him: If you think there be any neceſſity of your coming to God, and being ſav'd eternally, it muſt be by faith in the Son of God.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Laſtly, faith is neceſſary or elſe you muſt certainly periſh, certainly be damned, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.18, 36. <hi>He that believeth on him, is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, but he that believeth not is condemned already, becauſe he hath not believed in the name of the onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son of God:</hi> whoever doth not believe on the name of the onely begotten Son of God, is condemned already; O what a ſad thing to be a condemned man! and in the 36 <hi>v. he that believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on the Son, hath everlaſting life, he that believeth not the Son ſhall not ſee life, but the wrath of God abideth on him;</hi> a <hi>condemned</hi> man, a man that hath the wrath of God abiding upon him, a man that is in a periſhing condition: in <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. <hi>He that believeth and is baptized ſhall be ſaved, but he that believeth not ſhall be damned.</hi> Here's the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:94121:63"/>of faith now, <hi>Damnation</hi> without it, <hi>Salvation</hi> with it; ſo then you ſee that queſtion anſwered.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now come to the improvement, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences that I ſhall draw from this point; that faith lyes under a command; and</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Inf.</hi> 1. Firſt, I infer hence, that we are dull &amp; backward of our ſelves to believe; when things lye under Commands, it's an argument there is an indiſpoſition and averſeneſs in the natures, and wills, and hearts of thoſe that are Commanded. God commanded <hi>Moſes</hi> to go and deliver his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> what excuſes had <hi>Moſes?</hi> and what a multitude of objections did he make, and yet God commanded him to go and do the ſervice; ſo when God doth put us upon believing by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, it ſhews our natures are very dull and backward to believing, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.25. <hi>O fools and ſlow of heart to believe all that the Prophets have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken:</hi> The Prophets have given out commands to believing as well as promiſes: And they were fools and ſlow of heart to believe all that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets had ſpoken. So that we may take notice of our backwardneſs and dullneſs to this work of faith, ſeeing it lyes under a command.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I infer from hence, the willingneſs of the Lord to have poor ſinners receive the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit that is to be had by Jeſus Chriſt; becauſe he <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands</hi> them to believe; will not you of your ſelves do it? then I <hi>command</hi> you, ſaith he, to believe; and what's the benefit? you may ſee in <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. <hi>whoſoever believes, ſhould not periſh:</hi> here's great benefit, to be kept out of Hell, to be kept from wrath to come, and to have everlaſting life. Now can you have greater benefit then to be delivered from all evil, and enjoy all good: God commands
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:94121:63"/>us therefore to believe, that we might partake of theſe benefits. God commands men to <hi>repent,</hi> he would have them repent and be ſaved, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.9. ſo here he commands them to <hi>believe,</hi> and he would have them come to the knowledge of the truth and be ſaved, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4. God commands you to believe in his Son Jeſus Chriſt, that you might not periſh but be ſav'd; he is very willing, <hi>why will you dye?</hi> why do not you come to my Son and believe in him? <hi>I have lay'd help upon him that is mighty;</hi> why do you not look for help from him? God is willing that poor ſinners ſhould have the benefit that is to be had from Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I infer from hence, a ſufficient anſwer to all Objections that a doubting Soul can make. Doubting ſouls are apt to make many Objections againſt believing, troubled ſouls are ready to raiſe Objections.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> I am not elected ſaith one, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not for me to believe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> What ſaith God here? dont thou look after thine election, that's a ſecret hidden thing, but here's a command that is viſible, and thy duty, and I command thee to believe on my Son Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> I am a great ſinner ſaith another, and God will not pardon my ſins.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I but God commands thee to believe, that thou mayeſt have pardon of thy ſins, though they be very great.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> I have relapſed often into the ſame ſin, into paſſion, and wantonneſs, and covetouſneſs, and worldlineſs, and the like: I have a hard heart ſaith another, I have no qualifications and diſpoſitions: The promiſes dont belong to me
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:94121:64"/>ſaith another, I am not humbled enough, I am dead, and dull, and weak, and it's not for ſuch a one as I am to believe in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Well know, there's nothing in us fits us to believe, and nothing ſhould hinder us from believing; why here's Gods command, and ſhall thy indiſpoſition, or thy ſins and fears croſs and null a command of the great God? whether ſhall prevail, Gods command, or thy fancy, thy ſins, indiſpoſitions, or want of qualifications? here's a command of the great God, that thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in his Son Jeſus Chriſt, ſtop therefore the mouth of every Objection, and ſay, well, here's my duty, God hath commanded me to believe; <hi>Moſes</hi> wrangles with God a great while, but he muſt go at laſt; ſo God hath commanded me to believe, and I will lay down all my Objections, and do my duty, I will believe in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: This concerns us all, that we ſhould not ſtick at any thing, but anſwer Death, Corruptions, Fleſh, and World with this, that he commands me to believe, and ſhall I not obey the voice of God? and when it is ſo for my good, and I ſhall have relief againſt all that troubles me, and burthens me, and the like.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, We may ſee here alſo, what is the right and beſt courſe for a troubled ſoul to take, being wounded with ſin, and wearied with its ſins: We uſually take the wrong courſe, and the wrong way; when we have ſin'd and offended God, we pray, we mourn, we groan, we reform, and labour to walk more exactly; theſe things are not to be condemned: I but it is not the right courſe to have the ſoul healed, and therefore all comes
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:94121:64"/>to little of this nature. Many have thoughts by ſuch courſes to pleaſe God, and to make God ſome amends for their ſins; but this will never do it, the right way is to hearken unto God here, <hi>I command you to believe;</hi> ſaith he, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.1. <hi>I write unto you that ye ſin not;</hi> yea, but we ſhall ſin; well, <hi>If any do ſin,</hi> what then? <hi>We have an Advocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the Righteous, and he is the propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation for our ſins;</hi> we are to go preſently to Jeſus Chriſt, who is our Advocate, and propitiation for our ſins, and to believe this; well, Jeſus Chriſt is my Advocate and propitiation for my ſin which I have fallen into through infirmity, or tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or incogitancy, or any occaſion whatſoever, this is the way. Did not <hi>Nathan</hi> deal thus with <hi>David</hi> when he had ſinned? he tells him, the Lord hath forgiven thy ſins; and <hi>David</hi> comes to his penetential Pſalms after his belief, that his ſin was forgiven; and that's the true repentance that flows from the apprehenſion of Gods mercy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us in the forgiveneſs of ſins: When the ſoul hath ſinned (obſerve it) it muſt be ſetled upon that which can take away ſin, and upon a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs that is not its own; but is far beyond its own; now who is that can do this, but the Lord Jeſus Chriſt?</p>
            <p>For the firſt, the ſoul muſt be ſetled upon him that can take away ſin, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 29. <hi>Behold the Lamb of God which takes away the ſin of the world;</hi> Behold him, and look upon him that takes away the ſin of the world, he ſhall take away your ſin, the guilt of it, the trouble of it, and the vexation of it; it muſt be the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, 'tis not your Prayers nor repentance, nor any thing comes
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:94121:65"/>from you can do it; no, 'tis the Lord Jeſus Chriſt alone that takes away ſin, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. <hi>When he had by himſelf purged our ſins;</hi> 'tis the Lord Jeſus Chriſt alone that purges away ſins; Chriſt being without ſin, comes to take away ſin, and to purge away ſin; ſo that he condemns ſin in the fleſh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. and our old man was Crucified with him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.6. ſo that now there is nothing man can do that tends to the taking away of ſin; there's nothing left for any man or woman in the world to do to take away ſin, but the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, he hath taken away ſin; and I am to believe on the Son of God who hath taken away ſin, and doth take away the ſins of his people, that they commit daily.</p>
            <p>And if you will ſay, as 'tis in the 16 <hi>Prov.</hi> 6. <hi>By mercy and truth iniquity is purged.</hi> By mercy and truth, what's the meaning of that? that is, by Gods promiſe in ſending Jeſus Chriſt, and his truth in performing his promiſe; iniquity is purged by Jeſus Chriſt whom he ſent, and fulfilled, and made good the promiſe; ſo that ſin is purged by Jeſus Chriſt, and by none elſe: Therefore when we have ſinned, we are to look to Chriſt, and to Chriſt alone.</p>
            <p>Secondly, So for righteouſneſs, it is Chriſt's muſt ſtand us in ſtead, not our own; as there is no ſin to be ſatisfied for now, but all is ſatisfied for in and by Jeſus Chriſt; ſo there is no new righteouſneſs to be wrought now by any for ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but what Chriſt hath already wrought; Chriſts righteouſneſs is everlaſting righteouſneſs, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect righteouſneſs; he hath brought in ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting and perfect righteouſneſs, and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. laſt, <hi>he was made ſin for us who knew no ſin, that we might be
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:94121:65"/>made the Righteouſneſs of God in him;</hi> made the righteouſneſs, how come we to be made? why by faith in him, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9. <hi>and be found in him, not having mine own Righteouſneſs, which is of the Law, but that which is through the faith of Chriſt, the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs which is of God through faith:</hi> So that the way for a ſoul that's troubled with ſin, and guilt of ſin (and the like) is to believe in the Lord Jeſus, and to reſt upon him who takes away ſin, and brought in a righteouſneſs that is ſufficient for us.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, if we muſt believe in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and can never be truly ſetled in our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, and peace, without faith in him; then let us fetch our comforts, our peace, our aſſurance from Chriſt by believing, and not from any thing of our own, not from our repentance, and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and Sanctification, for theſe are mixt with imperfections, theſe are defiled with our corruptions, theſe are ebbing and flowing; ſo will your comforts, and peace, and aſſurance be, ſo long as you feed them from theſe, theſe do not make us righteous before God; it may be before men, or in our own eyes may make us righteous, our repentance, our obedience, our holineſs; but they do not make us ſo before God; if we raiſe our comforts, and peace, and aſſurance from theſe, it is from our own actings, and this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours too much of a legal ſpirit; if we believe in Chriſt, and fetch all from him, it will be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and laſting, and ſolid, and will be unſhaken, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.24. It's a Propheſie of the Goſpel times, <hi>Verily ſhall one ſay, in the Lord have I righteouſneſs and ſtrength.</hi> I have none in my ſelf, and I can draw none from what ſelf doth; but in the Lord
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:94121:66"/>have I righteouſneſs and ſtrength. There is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient righteouſneſs, and there is ſufficient ſtrength to bear up my peace, and comfort, and aſſurance; ſo that the way to have ſolid comfort, peace, and aſſurance, is to believe in the Lord Jeſus, and to fetch all from him.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, If believing in the Son of God do lye under a command, then I infer from hence, that it will be our duty to enquire whether we have obeyed this command, and do believe in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and believe the right way, for there is ſome kind of faith in Chriſt, which is not a right faith; the Goſpel tells us of ſome that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, yet afterwards fell off from Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Now how ſhall we come to know whether we do believe aright in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God or no? this may be of uſe unto us. I ſhall anſwer it in ſeveral particulars.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that faith which is a true and right faith in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, it follows conviction of unbelief, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.8, 9. <hi>When he is come, he will reprove,</hi> or as it is in your Margins, <hi>Convince</hi> the world of ſin, <hi>becauſe they believe not on me,</hi> that's the Son. The ſpirit of God when it comes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces men and women of their unbelief, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces them of the evil, of the greatneſs of this ſin above all ſins; you think it may be other ſins are very great and grievous ſins, Drunkenneſs, Whordom, Idolatry (and the like) yea, but <hi>unbelief</hi> is the great ſin of all, that's the ſoul damning ſin, and when <hi>faith</hi> comes, all other ſins are taken away; but if you be unbelievers, the guilt of all your other ſins are bound upon you; ſo that it convinces the ſoul of <hi>unlelief;</hi> now have you had
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:94121:66"/>any conviction of what unbelieving hearts you have naturally? how backward you are to believe? how you put away promiſes and motions of the ſpirit? well, if you have a right faith, it follows conviction of unbelief.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if you would know whether your faith be right or no in the Son of God, then anſwer how you came by your faith: How came you by your faith? is it from your ſelves, wrought by your own fancies, from your reaſonings? is it a fillo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtical faith only; as thus, he that believes ſhall be ſaved; I believe, and therefore I ſhall be ſaved? this now is but a work of your own reaſoning; but the faith that is right is wrought by the power of God, and is the gift of God, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.12. <hi>Buried with him in Baptiſm, wherein you are riſen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raiſed him from the dead.</hi> There was the operation of God in raiſing Chriſt from the dead, and the ſame operation of God is put forth in the hearts of thoſe that do believe; and the <hi>Epheſians</hi> they could witneſs unto it, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.19. <hi>And what</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is the exceeding greatneſs of his power to us ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power, which he wrought in Chriſt, when he raiſed him from the dead, and ſet him at his own right hand in the heavenly places.</hi> Why there was <hi>power,</hi> and <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and <hi>exceeding greatneſs</hi> of power towards us who do believe, yea, <hi>according to the working of his mighty power;</hi> the power that raiſed Chriſt from the dead, even that mighty power was put forth in our ſouls to raiſe us out of the grave of unbelief, to believe in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; ſo that in the 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.5. <hi>our Goſpel,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>came not unto you
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:94121:67"/>in word onely, but alſo in power, and in the Holy-Ghoſt.</hi> The power of the Holy-Ghoſt was put forth in working faith in the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> and ſo the power of God, and his ſpirit is put forth in the working faith in any ſoul; and uſually ſome promiſe, or ſome Goſpel truth is ſet upon the heart in power where there is a right faith wrought; as, <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you reſt;</hi> and <hi>God ſo loved the world, as he gave his onely begotten Son, that whoever believes in him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life;</hi> and <hi>whoever will, let him come without money, and without price,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.28, 29. <hi>Now we, Brethren, as</hi> Iſaac <hi>was, are the Children of promiſe,</hi> Children that are born of the promiſe, <hi>But as then,</hi> he that was born after the fleſh, perſecuted him that was <hi>born after the Spirit,</hi> &amp;c. ſo then they are born after the ſpirit, the ſpirit ſets on ſome promiſe, ſome word of God which is a ſeed of faith, and of grace, and life in the ſoul; and ſo you come by your faith that way.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That faith which is right in the Son of God, excludes all boaſting, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.27. where is <hi>boaſting then?</hi> 'tis <hi>excluded;</hi> by what Law, of works? nay, but <hi>by the Law of faith;</hi> 'tis <hi>faith</hi> that excludes boaſting, and <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.2. <hi>If</hi> Abraham <hi>were juſtified by works, he hath whereof to glory, but not before God.</hi> So the ſoul now, if it were juſtified by its own actings, it hath cauſe to boaſt; but he that is juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in Chriſt, he hath no cauſe to boaſt; the ſoul ſees it could never come to Chriſt except the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had drawn it; it ſees that Chriſt hath done all for it, taken away its ſin, and put upon it his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; ſo that the ſoul ſees no cauſe to boaſt at all.</p>
            <pb n="127" facs="tcp:94121:67"/>
            <p> Fourthly, Where there is true faith in the Son of God, that ſoul ſees a luſtre in holineſs, in grace and glory, in the perſon, in the life, in the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, in the doctrine, in the ordinances of Jeſus Chriſt; others ſee no beauty, nor worth in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.14. <hi>The word was made fleſh, and dwelt among us; and we beheld his glory, (the glory as of the onely begtoten of the Father)</hi> what a glory did we behold in the perſon of Chriſt? though he was cloathed with fleſh, and had put on our Sack-cloth, yet we beheld a glory in him, even the glory of the Father, full of grace, and full of truth; a believing ſoul ſees a luſtre in Jeſus Chriſt, more glorious than the Sun; and ſo in his <hi>Life,</hi> what a glorious ſin-leſs life he liv'd and lead; and ſo in his ſufferings, glorying in the Croſs; <hi>God forbid,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, that I ſhould glory ſave in the Croſs of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> ſo in the Doctrine of Chriſt, what a glorious Doctrine is it? 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. laſt; <hi>but we all with open face beholding as in a glaſs the glory of the Lord,</hi> (that's in the Goſpel) <hi>are changed into tho ſame Image from glory to glory;</hi> In the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Goſpel there is a glory, a marvellous glory. 'Tis called <hi>marvellous light</hi> in <hi>Peter;</hi> ſo in all the Ordinances of Jeſus Chriſt, there is a luſtre, a glory in every thing of Jeſus Chriſt, he hath ſtamp'd ſomething of his own Image, and glory, and excellency upon it. In 5 <hi>Cant.</hi> ſay the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Jeruſalem, What is thy beloved more than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers beloved?</hi> they ſaw no great matter in him, <hi>O my beloved is white and ruddy, the chiefeſt of ten thouſand,</hi> ſhe ſaw a glory which they could not ſee.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, That faith which is right in the Son of God, it intereſts the whole heart in Chriſt, not a
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:94121:68"/>part, but the whole heart, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.37. <hi>Philip</hi> ſaid, if thou believeſt with <hi>all thine heart,</hi> and he anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſaid, I believe that Jeſus is the Son of God, my whole heart runs out to this; ſo that where faith in Chriſt is true, there the whole heart is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted in Chriſt, the underſtanding, the will, the affections, they are taken up with Chriſt, he is highly eſteemed in the underſtanding, he is fully cloſed with by the will, he is greatly loved and delighted in by the affections, the ſoul doth now love him, and joy in him; he is the exceeding joy of his heart: When a woman is married to a rich man, that is loving, and ſuitable every way, her whole heart is carried out to him; ſo when the ſoul is married to Chriſt, the whole heart is taken up with him, and runs out ſtrongly unto him.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, The ſoul that doth believe in Chriſt, ſets up Chriſt, and all of Chriſt, and nothing but Chriſt. No King ſaid the Jews but <hi>Caeſar,</hi> ſo ſaith the ſoul, no King but Jeſus Chriſt, we have no King but Chriſt ſaith the believing ſoul, it ſets up the perſon of Chriſt, it ſets up the Laws of Chriſt, it ſets up the Ordinances of Chriſt, no Prophet but Chriſt, no High-Prieſt but Chriſt; ſo ſaith the ſoul that is rightly united to Chriſt by faith, &amp; believes aright in him; yea, it ſets up the worſt of Chriſt, above the beſt of the world; whatever place, or profit, or honour the world affords, the ſoul that is rightly believing in Chriſt, ſets up the worſt of Chriſt above it all. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.24 &amp;c, <hi>By faith</hi> Moſes <hi>when he was come to years, refuſed to be called the Son of</hi> Pharoah's <hi>Danghten.</hi> What <hi>Moſes,</hi> will you refuſe to be Son to <hi>Pharoah</hi>'s Daughter,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:94121:68"/>to be Heir to the Crown, will you refuſe that? I, he refuſes to be called the Son of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>chooſing rather to ſuffer affliction with the people of God, then to enjoy the pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon;</hi> what will you refuſe the pleaſures of the Court, the choiceſt pleaſures that can be invented? I, let them go for the afflictions of Gods people; and mark in the 26. v. <hi>Eſteeming the reproach of Chriſt greater riches, than the Treaſures in</hi> Egypt. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of Chriſt, or reproach for Chriſt; to be called a <hi>Phanatick,</hi> a <hi>Seditious fellow,</hi> a <hi>Schiſmatick,</hi> and the like; he did eſteem that more than all the treaſures in <hi>Egypt:</hi> So that the worſt of Chriſt, which is reproaching, and Perſecution, and Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and Impriſonment, and Baniſhment, it eſteems all for Chriſt, and therefore ſaith <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 8.18. <hi>I reckon that the ſufferings of this preſent time, are not worthy to be compared with the glory which ſhall be revealed in us.</hi> Alas, what's in theſe ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings to the glory that is to be had by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, The ſoul that doth rightly believe in Chriſt, doth bring its heart and will, to be one with the will of Chriſt. As Chriſt who had faith in God, and ſaid, My God, my God, he ſaid, <hi>Not my will, but thy will be done.</hi> So the Soul that believes in Chriſt rightly, ſaith, not my will, but thy will be done. It's brought over to the will of Chriſt, <hi>I live not,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, but Chriſt lives in me;</hi> Chriſt hath his will altogether, in me I have no will but Chriſts will: <hi>What do you weeping and breaking my heart? I am ready not to be bound onely, but to dye for the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> he dyed for him, and laid down his life to fulfill the will of God;
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:94121:69"/>and <hi>Paul</hi> had the ſame will that he had, and <hi>we have the mind of Chriſt,</hi> ſaith he.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, Laſtly, You have here one note in the Text, and that is <hi>Love,</hi> faith in the Son of God doth work love in the Soul: and therefore mind the connexion of theſe Commands; this is his Commandment, that we ſhould believe on the name of his Son Jeſus Chriſt. And <hi>Love</hi> one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as he gave us Commandment: The more ſaith you have in Chriſt, the more love you will have to others; for we do ſee in Chriſt, ſo much love to us that were ſo unworthy, ſo ſinful, in ſo damnable an eſtate and condition, that we will have love and pity towards the worſt, and thoſe are Godly, we ſhall have love to them becauſe they are in the ſame condition with our ſelves, we ſee that they are Brethren, they are Members of Chriſt, and they have the ſame precious faith with our ſelves, that they are glorious through the Robe of Chriſts Righteouſneſs put upon them, I, we ſee that they are Heirs together with our ſelves of the ſame grace, and in time ſhall be of the ſame Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that they are Heirs with Chriſt, and Co-heirs with him, and ſo upon this account they come to love them, and faith works by love. O the love that is in the Soul that hath a right ſaith in Jeſus Chriſt, it's full of love! Thus then you ſee now to know whether your faith be right in Jeſus Chriſt, being commanded to believe in him.</p>
            <p>One thing more, and that is, if faith lye under a Command; let us all then be obedient to this Command, and labour to believe in his Son Jeſus Chriſt more and more, if we have no faith let us do it; if we have faith let us do it more and more.
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:94121:69"/>I ſhall give you two or three motives, and anſwer a queſtion, and ſo conclude.</p>
            <p>Firſt for Motives, know you can never truly love God till your ſins are forgiven you, you will think God is not your God, till your ſins are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given; but if you find that your ſins are forgiven you, you will love God then to purpoſe; you will love God then in truth, and in ſtrength; <hi>Mary</hi> loved much, why many ſins were forgiven her; now unleſs you believe in Jeſus Chriſt, you cannot have the forgiveneſs of your ſins; and ſo you will be queſtioning whether God love you, or whether he be not a hard God, and a hard Maſter, and dont pardon your ſins, and ſo you cannot love God truly, and love God with ſtrength. If therefore you would love God with truth, and ſtrength, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in his Son Jeſus Chriſt, that you may know your ſins are forgiven.</p>
            <p>Secondly, This believing in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, makes our perſons very acceptable unto God. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.6. <hi>he hath made us accepted in his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved.</hi> How are we made accepted, by faith in him? if we have not faith in him, we are not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted; therefore the Apoſtles put us to do all in the name of the Lord Jeſus, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.17. There's the acceptation of your perſons.</p>
            <p>And ſo of your Prayers, our Prayers will never ſpeed in Heaven, and have gracious Returns, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we believe in the Son of God; 'tis for Chriſts ſake that our Prayers are heard, as you may ſee in the verſe before the Text, and the Text together; <hi>whatſoever we ask we receive of him, becauſe we keep his Commandments.</hi> And what's one Command? <hi>That we belieive on the Name of his Son Jeſus Chriſt;</hi>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:94121:70"/>why now our Prayers come to be heard, when we keep his Commandments.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, It is that which doth exalt the grace of God, and honours him very much, to believe in his Son Jeſus Chriſt. It's ſaid in 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. <hi>He that believes not, hath made God a Lyar. He that believeth on the Son of God, hath the witneſs in himſelf.</hi> There's encouragement to believe in the Son of God; <hi>He that believeth not God, hath made him a Lyar, becauſe he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son.</hi> And this is one record, that God hath given us eternal life in him. And this is another, that he Commands us to believe in him, that we may have this eternal life: Now what a diſhonour is this to the God of truth, to make him a lyar; but now to believe in his Son doth exalt the free grace of God, God hath made all the promiſes to Jeſus Chriſt, and in Chriſt they are all yea, and Amen. And mark it, <hi>All the promiſes of God in him are Yea, and and in him Amen, unto the Glory of God by us,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20. When we believe in his Son Jeſus Chriſt, in whom they are all concentred, in whom they are all yea, and Amen; but if you do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in the Son of God. They are not all to the honour of God; God hath not his glory in that way that he looks for, by Jeſus Chriſt. So that we ſhould believe in the Son of God, becauſe it doth exalt his honour, and his free grace, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motes his Glory abundantly; and the contrary brings reproach, and diſhonour upon God. One queſtion more.</p>
            <p>But happily ſome will ſay, I cannot believe; what ſhould I do?</p>
            <p>To that Soul, and to all of us I would ſay thus much.</p>
            <pb n="133" facs="tcp:94121:70"/>
            <p> Firſt, attend diligently unto the means by which God works faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.17. <hi>Faith comes by hearing, and hearing, by the word of God.</hi> Attend now unto the means, the Goſpel eſpecially, which is the means that God hath appointed to work faith by, and doth work faith by, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.13. <hi>In whom ye alſo truſted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the Goſpel of your Salvation:</hi> When they heard the word of truth, the Goſpel of Salvation; then they came to truſt in him; So when people do attend unto the means of Grace, and attend ſeriouſly unto it; God doth work faith, and increaſe faith where it is, by the ſame means. You know Pipes dont give water, but water comes through Pipes; ſo the Goſpel is the Pipe through which God lets out this water of grace, and conveys it unto us, and will you ſee it performed? in <hi>Acts</hi> 13.48. And <hi>when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the word of the Lord, and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed.</hi> When they heard the Goſpel Preached, as many as were ordained to eternal life believed, they attended upon the word, and the means of grace, and it was not in vain they believed.</p>
            <p>Attend therefore upon the Goſpel, and the word Preached, as an Ordinance of God, appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and deſigned of God purpoſely to work faith in your Souls, many perſons they come to hear the Word, they come only to hear a man what he can ſay, and what notions and new things there may be; but they come not to it as an ordinance of God appointed to work grace and faith in the ſoul, and ſo miſs of their expectation upon that account.</p>
            <pb n="134" facs="tcp:94121:71"/>
            <p> Secondly, Conſider how freely Jeſus Chriſt is offered in the Goſpel, and offered unto you, and at what a cheap rate Chriſt is to be had. In <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55, come without money, and without price, come and drink of the waters of life freely. Why the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is a free gift, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.15. ſaith the Apoſtle, not as the offence, ſo alſo is the <hi>free gift.</hi> A <hi>free gift</hi> Jeſus Chriſt and grace is; and <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.10. If thou haddeſt known the <hi>gift of God;</hi> O Chriſt is the gift of God, and what is required now, but receiving of this gift? will you not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a gift, and ſuch a gift as this is when it is tendred to you by God himſelf, and tendred to you in ſuch a glorious manner, and God doth put off this rich gift at a very low rate, if you will receive it, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.20. <hi>I ſtand at the dore and knock, if any man hear my voice and open the dore, I will come into him;</hi> and Ch. 22.17. <hi>whoſoever will, let him come and take of the water of life freely;</hi> here's Chriſt with the water of life, and bread of life, with his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, with all that is uſeful for you for the preſent, and to eternity, here he is, receive him; O how great will our condemnation be if we dont receive him, when as he is offered ſo freely to us!</p>
            <p n="3">3. Laſtly, you cannot believe you ſay, and I believe you too; you cannot believe: I but pray unto God to inable you to believe. And that ſhould be one great requeſt of our ſoules dayly, that God would enable us to believe, and that he would work Faith in us: why? it's the gift of God; and he is a <hi>giving God,</hi> he gives liberally and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braids not: he will not upbraid you with your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief: but if you will come and beg Faith in God, and power to work that grace in you, he is ready
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:94121:71"/>to do it; in the 17. <hi>of Luke,</hi> ſay the Diſciples, <hi>Lord we believe, encreaſe our faith;</hi> ſo ſay you, Lord work faith in my ſoul, I can never pleaſe thee, nor get any good unleſs thou work faith in me; and that in <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.45. Every man therefore that hath heard and learned of the Father, cometh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me; O hearken to the Fathers teaching in the Goſpel, the fathers revealing of Chriſt, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries he hath made, and receive every truth he hath given out concerning Jeſus Chriſt; and then he that hath heard and learned of the Father, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto the Son: O pray unto the Father to ſpeak to your hearts, and to teach your ſouls, that ſo you may come to Jeſus Chriſt, and believe in the Son, and have all thoſe great things that are to be had by him.</p>

            <p>THe Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> writes to the Church of <hi>Philippie,</hi> and notwithſtanding they were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Chriſtians, and a choice Church, yet they had need of exhortation and quickning up to their duty, and by ſtrong arguments he preſſes them here to many duties.</p>
            <p>If therefore there be any conſolation in Chriſt, if any comfort of love, if any fellowſhip of the ſpirit, if any bowels and mercies, fulfil ye my joy, that ye be like minded, having the ſame love, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of one accord, of one mind.

            <p>We read in Scripture of the <hi>mind of God, Jer.</hi> 19.5. neither came it into my <hi>mind,</hi> ſaith God, we read of the mind of the ſpirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.27. he that ſearcheth the heart, knoweth what is the <hi>mind of the ſpirit;</hi> and here we read of the <hi>mind of Chriſt,</hi> let this mind be in you, which was alſo in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
            <p>Now the word <hi>mind</hi> in Holy writ, doth ſignifie ſometimes the heart, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.19. ſerving the Lord with all humility of <hi>mind,</hi> that is, with all

            <p>Sometimes it ſignifies the <hi>underſtanding,</hi> as in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.14. Their <hi>mind</hi> was blinded, (ſpeaking of the Jews) that is, their <hi>underſtandings</hi> were blinded.</p>
            <p>Sometimes it ſignifies the thoughts of the heart, <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.11. A fool uttereth all his <hi>mind,</hi> that is, all he thinks, all the thoughts of his heart.</p>
            <p>Sometimes it ſignifies the <hi>will,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.2. feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the overſight thereof, not by conſtraint, but <hi>willingly;</hi> not for filthy lucre, but of a <hi>ready mind,</hi> that is, with your wills, willingly, and cheerfully.</p>
            <p>Sometimes its put for the <hi>affections,</hi> and the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of thoſe affections, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.7. he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted in you, when he told us your earneſt deſire, your mourning, your <hi>fervent mind</hi> towards me; that is, your fervent affection towards me. <hi>Mind</hi> ſignifies the <hi>affections.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the affecting of a thing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.5. Thoſe that are after the fleſh, do mind the things of the fleſh; that is, their affections do affect the things of the fleſh.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, <hi>Mind</hi> in Scripture doth ſignifie the aims and intentions of a man, <hi>Pro.</hi> 21.27. The Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the wicked is abomination to the Lord; how much more when he bringeth it with a <hi>wicked mind?</hi> that is, with a wicked intention. When the intentions and aims of a man are wicked, then his Sacrifice is much more abomination. So that in all the ſenſes the word <hi>mind</hi> is uſed in Scripture,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:94121:73"/>and all theſe may be taken in here; for the heart, and the underſtanding, and the thoughts, and the will, and affections, and the intentions: now the point that I will commend unto you, is onely this,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> That Churches and Chriſtians ſhould be of the ſame mind that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is of.</p>
            <p>1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.16. ſaith the Apoſtle there, ſpeaking of himſelf, and the Church of <hi>Corinth, We have the mind of Chriſt.</hi> We have Chriſts underſtanding, Chriſts heart (and the like) ſo in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.1. arm your ſelves likewiſe with the <hi>ſame mind;</hi> let the ſame mind be in you.</p>
            <p>Now it may be ſaid, is it poſſible for any Church, or any perſon to have the mind of Chriſt?</p>
            <p>Firſt, I anſwer, we muſt <hi>aim</hi> at it to have the mind of Chriſt, Chriſt is the Copy written for us to aim at. The Scripture doth hold out perfect rules, and perfect patterns unto us, which dont note our perfection, but helps our imperfection, that we which are imperfect ſhould reach to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, aim at the mind of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I anſwer, we are to have the ſame mind in kind, though not in degree; a new born Babe is of the ſame kind that a man is, though he be not come to that degree, and ſtate of a man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Well now, what is the mind of Chriſt?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> In general I ſay, the whole Goſpel is the mind of Chriſt; the whole word of God; there you have Chriſts mind, and Gods mind. But that's large, we will therefore come a little more cloſe, and what I find by ſearching the Goſpel, I ſhall give you in particulars.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Chriſt's mind was a Publick mind, not a
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:94121:73"/>private Domeſtick ſelfiſh mind; he did not ſeek nimſelf, but he ſought the good of others; ſaith the Apoſtle in the verſe before my Text, <hi>Look not every man on his own things, but every man alſo on the things of others;</hi> Chriſt had a publick mind, and would have a publick mind in us, Chriſt neglected himſelf to do good to others, he ſought not his own cred it, nor his own pleaſure or preſerment and advantage when they would have made him a King, he denyed himſelf; <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.14. The Lord Chriſt did nothing for himſelf, but all for us, he came from heaven for us, he took our nature upon him for us, he Preach'd for us, I, and he ſuffered for us, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.26. <hi>Meſſiah ſhall be cut off, but not for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi> He was cut off by death, but not for himſelf, but for us; So that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt he had a publick mind, a publick ſpirit, a publick heart; <hi>he became poor for us,</hi> 2 Cor. 8. <hi>He pleaved not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> Rom. 15.3. So then, let this mind of Chriſt be in you, to have a publick mind for the publick good to act for others; and not a ſelfiſh mind, altogether for ſelf?</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Lord Chriſt had a pure mind; the Scripture ſpeaks of a <hi>defiled mind, Tit.</hi> 1.15. Thoſe that believe not their very minds are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed: it ſpeaks of a <hi>carnal mind, Rom.</hi> 8.6. It ſpeaks of a <hi>fleſhly mind, Col.</hi> 2.18. But Chriſt had no defiled mind, no carnal mind, no fleſhly mind; but the Lord Jeſus Chriſt had a pure mind, pure heart, pure affections, pure will, pure inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the like, his mind was a pure mind; and therefore he ſaith, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. The Devil comes and finds nothing of his in me; when the Devil comes, he finds no impurity in Chriſt, and <hi>which
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:94121:74"/>of you convinceth me of ſin,</hi> ſaith Chriſt; he had a pure mind, and therefore it's ſaid, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.26. <hi>he was holy, and harmleſs, ſeparate from ſinners,</hi> he was holy in his nature, and underſtanding, and will, and affections, and heart and ſpirit. He was pure from all errors, and all opinions that do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file the underſtanding, or the judgment, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.3. I fear leaſt by any means, as the Serpent beguiled <hi>Eve,</hi> through his ſubtlety, <hi>ſo your minds ſhould be corrupted from the ſimplicity that is in Chriſt:</hi> Chriſts ſpirit was pure, and there was no mixture, where there is a mixture, there is not ſimplicity; Chriſt had a pure mind from all errors, and all defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: Now let this mind be in you alſo which was in Chriſt Jeſus; this pure mind be in you.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Lord Chriſts mind was a <hi>willing,</hi> and a <hi>ready mind</hi> to do good, <hi>Math.</hi> 8.3. If thou wilt, thou canſt make me clean; <hi>I will,</hi> ſaith he preſently, <hi>be thou clean;</hi> how willing and ready was the Lord Chriſt, he was not backward, he did not ſhift off doing good, as we uſe to do ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times, but he would rather prevent men, as you may ſee in the impotent man, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.6. <hi>Wilt thou be made whole,</hi> ſuch a ready mind was in Chriſt to do good; that where it was not look'd for, he would do it and prevent men, rather then not do good; <hi>Pſa.</hi> 40.8. <hi>I delight to do thy will O God;</hi> it was a great delight to Chriſt, he was very ready and forward to do good. Well, let this mind which alſo was in Chriſt be in you, a readineſs, a willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to do good.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The Lord Chriſts mind was a yeild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, a humble, and a condeſcending mind, <hi>v.</hi> 7. <hi>he made himſelf of no Reputation, and took upon him the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:94121:74"/>form of a Servant;</hi> O here was an humble conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending mind in Chriſt, that the Lord of glory, the Heir of the world, would take upon him the form of a Servant, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13. you read there how humble Chriſt was, that he riſeth from the Table, girds himſelf with a Towel, takes a Baſon of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and goes and waſhes his Diſciples feet. Here was condeſcending indeed, when the Lord and Maſter would go and waſh his Diſciples feet, when they were ſinful, and he himſelf without ſin; Chriſt ſaith, he came not to be Miniſtred unto, but to Miniſter, and he did Miniſter indeed. In <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. Learn of me ſaith he, for I am humble; never was there a greater perſon in the world, and never a greater perſon more humble than Chriſt was? O how did he condeſcend to the poor, and weak, and mean, and all ſorts and conditions of people, he would not break a bruiſed Reed, nor quench the ſmoaking flax; ſo yeilding and humble was he, he would converſe with ſinners and Publicans, when Phariſees and great ones ſtumbled at him, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came all things to all men, that he might do them good; well, let this mind be in you which was in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, the mind of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, was a <hi>ſingle mind,</hi> we read in Scripture of a <hi>double</hi> mind, <hi>James</hi> 1.8. a double minded man. But there was no doubleneſs of mind in Chriſt, he had a ſingle mind, <hi>Job</hi> 23.13. <hi>he is in one mind,</hi> the Lord Chriſt he is alwayes in one mind, others have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny minds; ſo many minds that they hardly know their own mind; but Chriſt had one ſingle ſincere mind; there was no doubleneſs, no diſſembling, no equivocating, no guile in his heart, nor in his
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:94121:75"/>lips, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.22. who did no ſin, neither was guile found in his mouth. As Chriſt ſaid of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaniel,</hi> behold an Iſraelite, <hi>in whom is no guile;</hi> ſo may we ſay of Chriſt much more, behold an Iſraelite in whom is no guile; there was nothing but ſingleneſs in Jeſus Chriſt, he had a ſingle mind, a ſingle ſpirit, a ſingle heart; and let this mind be in you, which alſo was in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, The Lord Chriſts mind was a fixed and a ſetled mind, he was not lead away with the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of the Elders, with the opinions of the Herodians, of the Sadduces, of the Scribes and Phariſees, with any wind of Doctrine; but it was a ſetled, ſollid, fixed, firm mind, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.8. it's ſaid, Jeſus Chriſt the <hi>ſame</hi> yeſterday, to day, and for ever; he was in the ſame ſetled mind al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, he did not chop and change his thoughts, and mind, and judgment; but was ſetled, and fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and not carried away with any opinions (or the like) and ſee what follows upon it, <hi>v.</hi> 9. <hi>be not carried away with divers and ſtrange Doctrines,</hi> Chriſt was not; be not you therefore carried about with divers and ſtrange Doctrines. How many in theſe dayes are carried up and down with every wind of Doctrine, with every opinion, but let this ſetled, fixed, firm mind be in you, which alſo was in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, Chriſts mind it was a heavenly mind, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.46. <hi>Never man ſpake like this man;</hi> rever man ſpake ſo heavenly, ſo graciouſly as this man did, Chriſt was full of Heaven; heavenly in his Doctrine, heavenly in his Prayers, heavenly in his Diſcourſe, altogether heavenly. In 3. <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. there's ſomething ſeems to croſs it; <hi>If I have told
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:94121:75"/>you earthly things, and ye believe not; how ſhall ye believe if I tell you of heavenly things?</hi> What, did Chriſt tell them of earthly things, and not hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things? The meaning of the place is this; 'tis true, I have drawn Parables taken from earthly things, but in them are couched heavenly matters; and if you dont underſtand them when I bring them down thus to your capacities, how would you underſtand then if I ſhould tell you of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things in their own nature and kind, and not ſuit them to your apprehenſions, or comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. Chriſt here ſpake of earthly things in this Chapter to <hi>Nicodemus;</hi> he ſpake of Generation, and of the wind, and water; theſe were earthly things, I but he had heavenly things in them, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, and the wind and water of the Spirit; ſo that Jeſus Chriſt he minded heavenly things; and ſo the next verſe, <hi>No man hath aſcended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven;</hi> why the Son of man is in heaven though he be here upon earth, his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections are there, his heart is there, his aims and intentions are there; O how heavenly was Chriſt in all his wayes? he breathed out heavenlineſs, and made ſpiritual uſes of all things he ſaw and met with; of the <hi>Vine,</hi> of the <hi>Dore,</hi> of the <hi>Sheep,</hi> of the <hi>Sun,</hi> of the <hi>water;</hi> now let this mind be in you which alſo was in Jeſus Chriſt, a heavenly mind.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, The Lord Chriſts mind was a zealous mind, a ſervent mind, in 2 <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. Chriſt was zealous there in driving them out of the Temple, that made his fathers houſe a den of Thieves: He was zealous againſt the Traditions, Doctrines, and Practiſes of the Scribes and Phariſees, the zeal of
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:94121:76"/>thy houſe hath eaten me up, ſaith he; a zealous mind he had, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. he was zealous againſt the tradition of the Elders; and in <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. he was zealous againſt the Scribes and Phariſees, woe to you Scribes, Phariſees, Hypocrites, often he pronounces <hi>woe</hi> to them; he had a zealous mind againſt all was corrupt and wicked: So, how zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous was Chriſt againſt the Churches for failings, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.2, 3, 4, 5. <hi>I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how thou canſt not bear them which are evil, and thou haſt tryed them which ſay they are Ap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſtles and are not, and haſt found them lyars, and haſt born, and haſt patience, and for my name ſake haſt laboured, and haſt not fainted.</hi> He commends them for what was good firſt; <hi>Nevertheleſs I have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what againſt thee, becauſe thou haſt left thy firſt love;</hi> I have ſomewhat againſt thee <hi>Epheſus, thou haſt left thy firſt love; Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do thy firſt works, or elſe I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick out of his place, except thou repent;</hi> Here's the zeal of Chriſt, <hi>I'le come,</hi> and I'le come <hi>quickly,</hi> and I'le come and <hi>put out</hi> the Candle, and <hi>break the Candleſtick;</hi> I will come and lay you waſte though you be a Church; if you dont return to your firſt works, and firſt love; The Lord had a zealous mind and ſpirit againſt declenſions, againſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clenſions in love, and grace; (and the like, ſo in <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.7. who in the dayes of his fleſh, when he had offered up Prayers and Supplications, with <hi>ſtrong crying and tears,</hi> unto him that was able to ſave; O how zealouſly did Chriſt Pray, when he prayed till the blood trickled down, Chriſt had a zealous mind: Now let this mind be in you alſo,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:94121:76"/>to have a zealous mind againſt traditions, ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions, againſt declinings in Grace, againſt Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy, and things of that nature.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, the Lord Chriſt had a peaceable and a quiet mind, in <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. ſaith Chriſt, <hi>learn of me, for I am meek;</hi> he had a quiet and a meek mind; and <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.19. <hi>he ſhall not ſtrive nor cry, neither ſhall any man here his voice in the ſtreets;</hi> he ſhall be meek, and quiet, and peaceable; it's ſaid of <hi>Seraiah</hi> in <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> that he was a <hi>quiet Prince;</hi> much more of Jeſus Chriſt, there was no ſtriving, no bitterneſs, no contention (and the like) but peaceable and quiet he was: Now, let this mind be in you which alſo was in Chriſt Jeſus, a meek, a quiet, a peaceable mind, the <hi>Ornament of a meek and a quiet ſpirit is of great price,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> ſpeaking of Godly women; ſuch a ſpirit had Chriſt, a quiet and a meek ſpirit, and let this be in Chriſtians, and in Churches.</p>
            <p>Tenthly, the mind of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, it was a <hi>ſubmiſſive mind,</hi> a ſubmiſſive mind to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will, whatever hard thing he ſhould meet withall; though he met with the hardeſt thing that was immaginable, yet Chriſt was ſubmiſſive un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it; in <hi>Luke</hi> 22.42. <hi>Father, if thou be willing remove the Cup from me; nevertheleſs, not my will, but thine be done:</hi> There was a cup prepared for Chriſt, that never was the like cup for any to drink; a a cup that had ſo much gall, ſo much of the wrath of God, a cup wherein all the guilt of our ſins were, and all the merit and deſert of them, <hi>this</hi> cup Chriſt muſt drink; well, ſaith he, Father, ſeeing I muſt drink it, <hi>not my will, but thy will be done.</hi> So that the Lord Chriſt had a ſubmiſſive
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:94121:77"/>mind to any hard and ſevere providence. We are apt to ſtumble and quarrel, and keep a do if things go croſs to our wills, and cannot bear them and ſay, Lord, not my will, but thy will be done. But let this mind be in you, which was in Chriſt Jeſus, a ſubmiſſive mind to the providences of God, to drink the bittereſt cup that he ſhall order out for you.</p>
            <p>Eleventhly, the Lord Chriſt had a <hi>Compaſſionate mind,</hi> he was full of bowels of compaſſion, and very tender hearted; <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.32. Then Jeſus called his Diſciples unto him, and ſaid, I have <hi>Compaſſion</hi> on the multitude, becauſe they continue now with me three dayes, and have nothing to eat, and I will not ſend them away faſting, leaſt they ſaint in the way; O I pitty them, I have compaſſion on them, I would not have them faint in the way; and ſo afterwards in <hi>Mat.</hi> when ſome came and cryed to him that he would ſhew them mercy, ſaith the Text, Chriſt had compaſſion on them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.3, 4. he was wonderful compaſſionate, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.15. <hi>We have not an High-Prieſt which cannot <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uched with the feeling of our Infirmities,</hi> the Lord Chriſt doth feel the infirmities of every member of his body, and in <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.17. It behoved him to be made like unto his Brethren, <hi>that he might be a merciful High Prieſt,</hi> He is ſenſible of our ignorances, and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, &amp; weakneſs, &amp; ful of bowels &amp; compaſſions. Why then let this mind be in you, which alſo was in Chriſt Jeſus, a compaſſionate, a merciful mind; he was the good <hi>Samaritan</hi> which had compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, when neither the Prieſt nor the Levite would.</p>
            <p>Twelfthly, Laſtly, the Lord Chriſt had a <hi>loving</hi> mind, a mind full of love, a forgiving mind, he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ad ſuch love as he could cover ſins, and forgive
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:94121:77"/>ſins, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.2. walk in love, as <hi>Chriſt alſo hath loved us.</hi> O Chriſt hath loved us, loved us and waſhed us in his own blood, loved us and lay'd down his life for us, loved us dearly, and ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, loved us even above himſelf; well, ſaith he, let this mind be in you, which alſo was in Chriſt Jeſus, walk in love, as Chriſt hath loved us. And he loved us ſo, as to forgive thoſe that wronged him, though they wronged him exceedingly, took away his garments, took away his credit, took away his liberty, took away his life; Father for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give them, they know not what they do, <hi>Luke</hi> 23.34. and therefore he appoints or commands, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.44. <hi>I ſay unto you, love your Enemies, bleſs them that curſe you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which deſpitefully uſe you, and perſecute you.</hi> Chriſt did ſo, let this mind be in you, which alſo was in Chriſt Jeſus. Thus you ſee what mind was in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Yet to reduce things to theſe four particulars.</p>
            <p>Firſt, to have the mind of Chriſt, is to have the ſame <hi>thoughts</hi> in you that Chriſt had; Chriſt had no ill thoughts in him, but rebuk'd ill thoughts, <hi>why think you evil in your hearts,</hi> as it is in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.17. <hi>How precious are thy thoughts unto me (ſaith</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid) ſo, precious are the thoughts of Chriſt, and of God towards poor ſinners. The Lord Chriſts thoughts were publick thoughts, pure thoughts, heavenly thoughts, thoughts of mercy and loving kindneſs; <hi>I know the thoughts that I think towards you,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 29.11. They were good thoughts, peaceable thoughts, loving thoughts; ſo there is in Chriſt, choice thoughts towards poor ſinners, <hi>Prov.</hi> 12.5. <hi>The thoughts of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous; are right;</hi> Chriſt was the righteous one, and
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:94121:78"/>all his thoughts were right thoughts, righteous thoughts, ſo now to have the ſame mind that Chriſt had, is to have the ſame <hi>thoughts</hi> that Chriſt had; have the ſame thoughts of God the Father, that he had; have the ſame thoughts of Truth that Chriſt had; have the ſame thoughts of Sin that Chriſt had, as an evil, as the greateſt evil; have the ſame thoughts of Grace, as Chriſt had; have the ſame thoughts of the Church, as Chriſt had; have the ſame thoughts of the worth of Souls, as Chriſt had; what will you give in exchange for your Souls? Chriſt valued a ſoul above all the world; now to have the mind of Chriſt, is to have the ſame thoughts of God, of perſons and things that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt had.</p>
            <p>Secondly, to have the ſame mind that Chriſt had, is to be carried forth with the ſame will and affections towards God and Man as Chriſt was: Now how was Chriſt carried forth towards God and man? <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.7.9. there you ſhall ſee; then ſaid I, <hi>Lo I come</hi> (in the Volume of the Book it is written of me) <hi>to do thy will, O God.</hi> I come, I come freely, I am coming to do thy will what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be, be it hard matters, diſgraceful mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, be it in the matter of my life; Loe, I come to do thy will O God; and ſo in the 9 <hi>v. Lo, I come to do thy will;</hi> I am not backward, but I come to do thy will, he was ready to make haſt, as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, I made haſt and delayed not to keep thy Commandments; ſo that to be carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out towards God, to do good, and to do the will of God as Chriſt was, is to have the very mind of Chriſt; <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.30. ſaith Chriſt, <hi>I ſeek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath ſent me.</hi>
               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:94121:78"/>I came, and I came freely and willingly, and nor to do mine own will, but the will of him that ſent me; ſo now to be carried out to do the will of God as Chriſt was towards God, and towards man, is to have the ſame mind that Chriſt had.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, to have the ſame mind that Chriſt had, is to live the ſame life that Chriſt did, where there is the ſame mind, there will be the ſame motions, and the ſame operations; now to have the mind of Chriſt, is to live the very life of Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. <hi>I live not,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, but Chriſt lives in me;</hi> O 'tis Chriſts life that I live; ſo in the 1 <hi>Phil.</hi> 21. <hi>To me to live is Chriſt,</hi> I dont ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count my life any life, if I dont live the life of Chriſt; and <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.11, 12. <hi>The Grace of God that bringeth ſalvation hath appeared unto all men;</hi> what's the <hi>Grace</hi> of God? Chriſt, and the Goſpel; the mind of Chriſt; <hi>Teaching us, that denying ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and worldly luſts, we ſhould live ſoberly, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, and Godly in this preſent world;</hi> Now to have the mind of Chriſt, is to live ſoberly, Righteouſly, and Godly in this world. Soberly in regard of our ſelves, Righteouſly in regard of men, Godly in regard of God. To have the mind of Chriſt, is to live the very life of Chriſt; 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.1, 2. <hi>For as much then as Chriſt hath ſuffered for us in the fleſh, arm your ſelves likewiſe with the ſame mind; for he that hath ſuffered in the fleſh, hath ceaſed from ſin.</hi> If you have ſuffered as Chriſt hath done, you will ceaſe from ſin, he hath ceaſed from <hi>dying</hi> for ſin, and you muſt ceaſe from committing of ſin. <hi>That he no longer ſhould live the reſt of his time in the fleſh, to the luſts of men, but to the will of God.</hi> So that if we have the mind of Chriſt, we will live the reſt of
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:94121:79"/>our time to the will of God; we muſt walk as he walked, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.3.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Laſtly, to have the ſame mind that Chriſt had, is to be carried out to the ſame end that he was, and his end was to do good to others, and to glorifie God; theſe were the intentions, and end, and mind of Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.38. <hi>God anointed Jeſus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghoſt, and with power; who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppreſſed of the Devil, for God was with him;</hi> here was his deſign, to do good to others; and his great deſign was to glorifie the Father alſo, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.50.54. <hi>and I ſeek not mine own glory,</hi> ſaith he, there is one that ſeeketh and judgeth, I ſeek not mine own glory, 'tis the glory of the Father that I ſeek; and <hi>v.</hi> 5, 4. <hi>Jeſus anſwered, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> I honour my ſelf, my honour is nothing, it is my Father that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noureth me, of whom ye ſay, that he is your God.</hi> My Father doth honour me indeed, and I do honour my Father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.4. <hi>I have glorified thee on the earth,</hi> &amp;c. That was the great deſign of the L. Jeſus Chriſt, to go up and down and do good, and to glorifie the Father, and honour him, now to be carried out to the ſame ends, and to have the ſame aim that Chriſt had, is to have the ſame mind that Chriſt had. Thus you ſee what was the mind of Chriſt, and what it is to have the ſame mind that Chriſt had.</p>
            <p>Now I ſhall ſhew you the Reaſons, why we ſhould have the ſame mind that Chriſt had.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> Firſt, we ſhould have the ſame mind, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are Chriſtians, we have Chriſts name, as you know thoſe that are <hi>Lutherans,</hi> they have the mind of <hi>Luther;</hi> thoſe that are <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> have the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:94121:79"/>mind of <hi>Calvin;</hi> thoſe are <hi>Platoniſts,</hi> have the mind of <hi>Plato;</hi> thoſe are <hi>Galleniſts,</hi> have the mind of <hi>Gallen:</hi> So we are <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and we ſhould have the mind of Chriſt, what a Chriſtian, and not the mind of Chriſt? why we are his Diſciples, and Diſciples uſe to have the mind of their Maſters, and of their Teachers, we ſhould learn his mind, and be of his mind; Eph. 4.21, 22. <hi>ye have not ſo learned Chriſt, if ſo be that ye have heard him, and have been taught by him, as the truth is in Jeſus.</hi> If you have heard Chriſt, and learned of him, you will be of his mind, you are his Diſciples, and the Diſciple is of the mind of the Teacher, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.6. <hi>As ye have therefore received Chriſt Jeſus the Lord, ſo walk ye in him.</hi> As ye have received his Doctrine, his mind, ſo walk in his Doctrine, and in his mind; we are Chriſtians, and therefore we ſhould be of the ſame mind with Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, thoſe that are true Churches and true Chriſtians, they are members of Chriſt, they are members of Chriſts body, and they ſhould be of the mind of the head; the members are ruled and governed by the head; now all true Churches, and Chriſtians, are the members of Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.15. <hi>But ſpeaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Chriſt.</hi> O ſpeak the truth in love, ſaith he, or truth it in love, and grow up in him (in Chriſt) in all things which is the head; you muſt grow up into his mind, becauſe ye are members, and he is the head; ſo in 2 <hi>Col.</hi> 7. <hi>Rooted and built up in him, and ſtabliſhed in the faith;</hi> ſtabliſhed in the Doctrine of Chriſt, <hi>abounding therein with Thanksgiving;</hi> Why? becauſe we are members of Chriſt, we ſhould therefore grow up
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:94121:80"/>in the faith of Chriſt, and in the doctrine and mind of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, We ſhould be of the ſame mind with Chriſt, becauſe the Lord Chriſt became like unto us, therefore we ſhould be like unto him, <hi>v.</hi> 7. <hi>and was made in the likeneſs of men,</hi> and ſo in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. <hi>For what the Law could not do in that it was weak through the fleſh, God ſending his own Son, in the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſinful fleſh, and for ſin condemned ſin in the fleſh.</hi> Chriſt was <hi>like us,</hi> in the likeneſs of ſinful fleſh, and condemned ſin in the fleſh; now what a vaſt diſtance was there between Chriſt and us? when Chriſt was in Heaven, the Son of God, had not he came down from Heaven, and taken our nature upon him, and been made like unto us, we could never have been made like unto him; for he muſt take away that black Image, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of our nature, and deformity, that we might be made like unto him; now the Lord Chriſt having done thus, we ſhould be like unto him upon that account, and if we be not of his mind, we ſhall never come to be like him, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.2, 3. beloved, <hi>now are we the Sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we ſhall be; but we know that when he ſhall appear, we ſhall be like him; for we ſhall ſee him as he is.</hi> Then ſhall we be perfectly like him, <hi>and every man that hath this hope in him, puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth himſelf, even as he is pure.</hi> If you have hope to be perfectly like him hereafter, you muſt be of his mind here, and purifie your ſelves even as he is pure; ſo that upon that account, that Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came like unto us in our nature, we ſhould be of his mind, that we may be like unto him in his nature.</p>
            <pb n="153" facs="tcp:94121:80"/>
            <p> Fourthly, we ſhould be of the ſame mind with Jeſus Chriſt, becauſe if we be not of his mind, we ſhall be of an evil mind, we ſhall be either of the worlds mind, and the worlds mind is bad enough, it lyes in wickedneſs, or of the Devils mind, and that's worſe; or of the fleſh's mind, and that's worſt of all; for the Devil, and the world work by our fleſh; now ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>to be carnally minded, is death,</hi> and the carnal mind is enmity unto God, it is not ſubject unto God, neither can it be. Now if you be not of Chriſts mind, you are either of the worlds mind, or the Devils mind, or the fleſh's mind, and that's death, and will end in death eternal, and you cannot pleaſe God.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, we ſhould be of the ſame mind that Chriſt is, becauſe this is a way to keep us from falling into errors, and corrupting opinions, and from damnable Hereſies (and the like;) thoſe have Chriſts mind, will admit of nothing but truth; they will not admit of the ſpirit of Antichriſt, and the ſpirit of errors, of which you read 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.3, 6.</p>
            <p>There's the ſpirit of Antichriſt, and the ſpirit of errors; now if men be of Chriſts mind, they will never admit of thoſe errors and Antichriſtian Doctrines. The Doctrine of Antichriſt, is the worſhipping of Images; now if you have Chriſts mind, you will never worſhip Images; <hi>Babes keep your ſelves from Idols.</hi> Antichriſts mind is, that Prieſts muſt not marry; if you be of Chriſts mind <hi>Marriage is honourable in all,</hi> and it will never ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of that Doctrine. So tranſubſtantiation, that's Antichriſts mind; but if you be of Chriſts mind, you will never admit of that, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.20. <hi>He ſhall
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:94121:81"/>ſend Jeſus Chriſt, which before was Preached unto you, whom the heavens muſt receive, until the times of reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of all things;</hi> he ſhall ſend him, he dont ſend him wherever the Sacrament is, and there turn the bread into Chriſts fleſh, and the wine into Chriſts blood, but he ſhall ſend Jeſus Chriſt, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was Preached unto you, <hi>whom the heavens muſt receive, until the times of reſtitution of all things;</hi> here's the mind of Chriſt now, and thoſe that have the mind of Chriſt, will not receive the mind of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt. So, invocation of Saints, that's the mind of Antichriſt, an erroneous, and a damnable Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; but here's the mind of Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.23. Whatſoever ye ſhall ask the Father <hi>in my name,</hi> not in <hi>Maries</hi> name, or <hi>Peter</hi>'s name, or this or that Saints name; but in <hi>Chriſts name.</hi> So for the Popes Supremacy, and the Lordlineſs of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates; if you have Chriſts mind, you will never entertain any thing of that, <hi>Luke</hi> 25. <hi>and he ſaid unto them, the Kings of the Gentiles exerciſe Lordſhip over them, and they that exerciſe authority upon them are called Benefactors: But ye ſhall not be ſo, but he that is greateſt among you, let him be as the younger, and he that is chief, as he that doth ſerve.</hi> What, you my Diſciples, and you to have Supremacy, you to have the Titles of Lords, and Holy, and Gracious (and the like?) it ſhall not be ſo among you, here's the mind of Chriſt; ſo in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.3. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as being <hi>Lords</hi> over Gods Heritage, but being enſamples to the Flock; no Lordlineſs, no dom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, power, greatneſs, nor glorious titles (and the like) here's the mind of Chriſt; ſo that if we have the mind of Chriſt, we ſhall be kept from e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors. So all traditions and ordinances of men,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:94121:81"/>and impoſitions &amp; inventions of men; <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.9. <hi>In vain they do worſhip me, teaching for Doctrines, the Commandments of men.</hi> That's a vain worſhip, which is worſhipping in vain, and <hi>v.</hi> 6. <hi>ye have made the Commandments of God of none effect, by your traditions.</hi> So in 2 <hi>Col.</hi> 20. <hi>wherefore if ye be dead with Chriſt from the Rudiments of the world, why as though living in the world are ye ſubject to ordinances,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>after the Commandments and Doctrines of men.</hi> Here's the mind of Chriſt, you muſt not be ſubject to ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and impoſitions of men, and their addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the worſhip of God; but have the mind of Chriſt, and you will admit of nothing, but what is from Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, we ſhould be of Chriſts mind, becauſe it is the way to union, to meeken and ſweeten ſpirits, and to make harmony between all ſorts, and to <hi>much</hi> unity, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.6, 7, 8, 9. <hi>The Woolf alſo ſhall dwell with the Lamb, and the Leopard ſhall lye down with the Kid, and the Calf, and the young Lyon, and the Fatling together, and a little Child ſhall lead them, and the Cow and the Bear ſhall feed, their young ones ſhall lye down together, and the Lyon ſhall eat ſtraw like the Ox.</hi> They ſhall be fed with the ſame meat, the mind of Chriſt, the Goſpel, and Goſpel truths, they ſhall eat and feed together, and the meaneſt in the Church ſhall have no harm by them; and he goes on, <hi>the ſucking child ſhall play on the hole of the Aſp, and the weaned child ſhall put his hand on the Cockatrice den;</hi> that is, the meaneſt in the Church ſhall not be hurt by the greateſt, nor infected by thoſe that were Dragons and Aſps be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, full of gall and bitterneſs, and venom (and the like) they ſhall be ſo cleanſed by the Doctrine
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:94121:82"/>of Chriſt, and the mind of Chriſt, that the meaneſt Saint ſhall have communion and converſe with them; and what follows? <hi>They ſhall not hurt, nor deſtroy in all my holy Mountain; for the earth ſhall be full of the knowledge of the Lord;</hi> there's the mind of Chriſt now; full of the mind of Chriſt that will purge out their malice, and bitterneſs, and enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and there will be ſuch a change and alteration, ſuch a harmony in affection, as they will eat toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Hear together, Pray together, Converſe together (and the like) and ſo there will be much unity among all thoſe that have the mind of Chriſt, which will be a bleſſed thing; for what ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 133.1. <hi>Behold, how good, and how pleaſant it is, for Brethren to dwell together in unity:</hi> Behold it, how beautiful and bleſſed a thing it is; and <hi>Acts</hi> 4.32. <hi>the multitude of them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, were of one heart, and of one ſoul;</hi> Why they were of Chriſts mind, and ſo of one mind; ſo then we ſhould be of Chriſts mind, that we may unite together, and live ſweetly, and meekly, and harmoniouſly together; and in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.10. 'tis that the Apoſtle urges the <hi>Ceriuthians</hi> unto, <hi>I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you Brethren, by the name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that ye all ſpeak the ſame thing, and that there be no diviſions among you; but that ye be perfectly joyned together in the ſame mind, and in the ſame judgment;</hi> and if we have Chriſts mind, we ſhall have the ſame mind and the ſame judgment, we ſhall be all of one mind.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, we ſhould be all of Chriſts mind, that ſo we may do our Chriſtian work wiſely, and underſtandingly: The Lord Chriſt did all things wiſely, and underſtandingly; all his work as he
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:94121:82"/>was a High Prieſt, all his work as he was a Prince, all his work as he was a Prophet, all his work as he was a private man. And if we have the mind of Chriſt, we ſhall do all things wiſely, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandingly, as becomes Chriſtians. Many Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are very fooliſh, and raſh, and inconſiderate, and do things untowardly. Why? they go upon their own minds; but if we have the mind of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, we ſhall do all things wiſely, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagiouſly, for the glory of God, and good of others, and peace and comfort of our own ſouls.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, Laſtly, we ſhould be of the ſame mind that Chriſt is, becauſe if we be true Chriſtians, we have the ſame ſpirit that Chriſt had; where is the ſame ſpirit, there will be the ſame mind, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9. <hi>If any man have not the ſpirit of Chriſt, he is none of his:</hi> If you han't Chriſts ſpirit, no marvel you are not of his mind; but if you be true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, you have the ſpirit of Chriſt, and if you have the ſpirit of Chriſt, you muſt needs be of the mind of Chriſt; for in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17. <hi>He that is joyned to the Lord, is one ſpirit;</hi> it is a ſpirit of wiſdom and revelation; and a ſpirit that doth diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the mind of the Lord Jeſus unto the ſoul; the ſpirit (ſaith Chriſt) ſhall take of mine &amp; ſhew unto you, the ſpirit doth ſhew nothing unto thoſe where it is, but the mind of Chriſt; now if there be the ſame ſpirit, we ſhall be of the ſame mind. Thus then you ſee why we ſhould be of the ſame mind of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>I ſhall come to ſome application of the point.</p>
            <div type="application">
               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:94121:83"/>
               <head>Application.</head>
               <p n="1">1. This ſerves for reproof; and,</p>
               <p>Firſt, it reproves thoſe that are ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſts mind, as that they ſeldom or never mind Chriſt, <hi>they mind earthly things,</hi> as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith. O how many are there that mind Plays, and mind Pictures, and mind Hiſtories, and mind ſea affairs, winds, and weather! how many mind riches, and buying, and ſelling, and building, and eating, and drinking, and dreſſing, and things of this nature; that mind exchanges, and friends, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and no marvel they have not the mind of Chriſt; the <hi>Gadarens</hi> minded their Swine, and minded not Chriſt, but bad him go out of their Country; ſo thoſe that were bidden to the Feaſt, they minded their Wives, and Oxen, and Farms, but they minded not Chriſt; this now is reproof to ſuch.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is reproof to thoſe, that it may be do ſomewhat mind Chriſt, but not ſo as to live Chriſt, and to ſeek the good of others, and the glory of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.24.31. you have both theſe, <hi>Let no man ſeek his own, but every man an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>others wealth;</hi> that is, his ſpiritual wealth, to do his ſoul good; the welfare of Soul and Body, and Relations, and welfare of his mind; and in the 31 verſe, <hi>whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.</hi> Here's the great end we ſhould aim at, we ſhould live Chriſt, and ſeek the good of others, and ſeek the glory of God; but where are the men that do this? nay men live now ſo as they are a reproach to Chriſt,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:94121:83"/>and to the name of Chriſt, a diſhonour to God, and make a prey of their Brethren, they live ſo as if the Devil were their Copy to write after, and to imitate. If the Devil ſhould come up from Hell in the likeneſs of man, how could he live worſe then many men do that are called Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians; O the debauchedneſs, the blaſphemouſneſs, the oppreſſions, and the horrible evils that are committed in theſe our dayes, by thoſe that ſay they are Chriſtians; Chriſt told the Phariſees, <hi>ye are of your Father the Devil, and his works will ye do:</hi> So we may tell many in City and Country, you are of your Father the Devil, and his works you will do; what can they do worſe almoſt then they do, they are come to ſuch a height of wickedneſs? But let ſuch rather unchriſtian themſelves, than to live as they do, and be called Chriſtians. What will men not be of Chriſts mind, and yet be Chriſtians? called Chriſtians, and live like De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, and worldlings, and prophane wretches, that neither fear God nor man, better they had been Heathens then Chriſtians; it will be more eaſie for <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah, Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon,</hi> then for ſuch at the day of Judgment! So much for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this may be matter of humiliation to us all, that we are no more like to Chriſt, that we have not the ſame thoughts of God, of Truth, of Sin, of the World, that he had; the Lord Chriſt ſaith, be not conformed to the world, the faſhions of the world, the manners of the world, the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the world; that we ſhould not love the world, nor things of the world; that was Chriſts mind, that we ſhould forgive our Enemies, but
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:94121:84"/>we are not of Chriſts mind, though we have been long in the School of Chriſt, &amp; Diſciples of Chriſt; yet we are not of the mind of Chriſt; O how ſlow, and dull, and untoward are we to learn the mind of Chriſt! It's the mind of Chriſt, that people ſhould not caſt off Ordinances, and forſake the aſſembling of themſelves (and the like;) but how many do it in theſe dayes? O this ſhould be mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of humiliation to us all, that we come ſo ſhort of the mind of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it may be an uſe of examination to us, to examine whether we be of the ſame mind that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt was of; you may know it by what I have delivered to you already; have we a publick mind, a pure mind, a humble mind, a heavenly mind, a compaſſionate mind (and the like;) but I'le add ſomething elſe: would you know whether you are of the mind of Chriſt, yea or no? then,</p>
               <p>Firſt, if you are of Chriſts mind, you will love what Chriſt loved, and hate what he hated; now look into <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.9. <hi>he loved Righteouſneſs, and hated Iniquity;</hi> do you love Righteouſneſs? you have many go for Chriſtians, and Profeſſors; but come to dealing, and there's no righteouſneſs in their actions, they are all for what they can get, and wring, and ſcrape to themſelves, and don't <hi>love</hi> righteouſneſs; thou art no true Chriſtian, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever thou art, thou art but a baſtardly Chriſtian at the beſt; for where there is the ſame mind of Chriſt, and a true Chriſtian, there's loving of Righteouſneſs, and hating of Iniquity; See in 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. laſt, <hi>If ye know that he is Righteous, ye know that every one that doth Righteouſneſs, is born of him.</hi>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:94121:84"/>If ye be true Chriſtians ye are born of God, and you do Righteouſneſs, and Ch. 3.10. <hi>In this the Children of God are manifeſt, and the Children of the Devil, whoſoever doth not Righteouſneſs, is not of God.</hi> Many borrow and never pay again, is here any Righteouſneſs? many have pledges and never reſtore them, is here any righteouſneſs? many they will put off ill wares with lying and ſwearing, is here righteouſneſs? if ſo be there be not Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs in mens actions; they have not the mind of Chriſt; they are not born of God, but they have the mind of the Devil, and of the World, and the fleſh, and it's a ſad condition: but here's the way to know whether we have the mind of Chriſt; we will love righteouſneſs, and hate Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, hate evil thoughts, and luſts, and all fraud, and cheating, and over-reaching one another.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if we would know whether we have the mind of Chriſt, we ſhall know it by this, then we will judge of things as Chriſt judged of them. <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.24. ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Judge not according to appearance, but judge righteous Judgement;</hi> ſo in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.7. <hi>Do ye look on things according to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearance.</hi> Men that have Chriſts mind will not judge according to outward appearance and ſemblances, and ſeemings; but they will judge righteous judgment; judge as Chriſt himſelf judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; Chriſt ſaith, bleſſed are the poor in ſpirit, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven; bleſſed are they that mourn, for they ſhall be comforted; bleſſed are the meek, for they ſhall inherit the earth; bleſſed are the pure in heart, for they ſhall ſee God. Do you judge right now where bleſſedneſs lyes? not in honours, nor pleaſures, nor things
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:94121:85"/>of this nature; no, it lyes in mourning for ſin, in poverty of ſpirit, in pureneſs of heart; if you be of Chriſts mind, you will be of Chriſts judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.15. <hi>The things that are highly eſteemed among men, are abomination with God.</hi> Now do you judge of the world as Chriſt judged? Chriſt look'd upon the world as a periſhing thing, as a defiled thing, and as that which will not ſatisfie the ſoul, but endanger every man and woman; do you judge of the world ſo? <hi>Why do you lay out your money for that which is not bread, and your labour for that which ſatisfieth not?</hi> Do you judge of all theſe things thus now? they are not <hi>bread</hi> for my ſoul, nor they will not <hi>ſatisfie</hi> my ſoul; I muſt uſe the world while I am here, and if I have enough to carry me to my Journeys end, 'tis well; in <hi>Acts</hi> 19.28. <hi>Great is</hi> Diana <hi>of the</hi> Epheſians, ſay thoſe of <hi>Epheſus.</hi> So ſay Catholicks of their Cathedrals, and pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous worſhip, great is <hi>Diana</hi> of the <hi>Epheſians;</hi> yea, but <hi>Diana</hi> and all her worſhip was abominable to God; many cry up their worſhip, and ſuch and ſuch things as are the inventions of men; but they are no more pleaſing to God than <hi>Diana</hi>'s Idols, Temple, and Worſhip. <hi>Paul</hi> would know no man after the fleſh; no, not Chriſt himſelf, he had the mind of Chriſt, and yet he would not know Chriſt after the fleſh, upon fleſhly grounds and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations; ſo do you know no man after the fleſh, but upon ſpiritual grounds, as they relate to God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if you have the mind of Chriſt, then you will ſee that in the truths of Chriſt, as will make you love the truth, and ſtand to it, and to venture all for truth, rather than part from it,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:94121:85"/>Chriſt he did witneſs to truth, in <hi>Joh.</hi> 18. and did teſtifie a good confeſſion before <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> and lay'd down his life for truth; now hence he ſaith in <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. <hi>If any draw back, my ſoul ſhall have no pleaſure in him;</hi> what, of my mind, and draw back from my truth, and my wayes? my ſoul ſhall have no pleaſure in him: what, draw back from Chriſt's Doctrine, and from the principles that have been wrought in you by that Doctrine? draw back from his worſhip, and from profeſſion of Chriſt, and practice of the Goſpel? <hi>my ſoul ſhall have no pleaſure in you;</hi> that is, my ſoul ſhall be exceedingly exaſperated againſt you, if you draw back from me and my Doctrine. <hi>Antipas</hi> held faſt the faith, the Church of <hi>Pergamus</hi> held faſt the faith of Chriſt; and <hi>Paul</hi> who had the mind of Chriſt, ſaw ſo much in the truth of Chriſt, as he ſaith, I am ready not onely to be bound, but to dye for the name of the Lord Jeſus. He ſaw rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and eternal life in the truths of Chriſt; ſo that if you have Chriſts mind, you will ſee that in Chriſts truth and Doctrines, and wayes, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, which will make you go on, and venture all rather than part with the ſame.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Laſtly, if you have Chriſts mind, you will act as Chriſt acted; <hi>Chriſt went up and down doing good,</hi> as in <hi>Acts</hi> 10. a man will not live idely, and out of a Calling, that hath the mind of Chriſt, a man will not be negligent in his Calling, and he will aim at Gods glory, and his neighbours good in his Calling, more then in getting of the world, honouring God, and doing good to his Neighbour, and thoſe he lives among, if he have the mind of Chriſt. Chriſt had nothing of the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:94121:86"/>world, but he would do good; Chriſt was much in Prayer, ſo will he; Chriſt was watchful, ſo will he; Chriſt denyed himſelf, and he will deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he will walk even as Chriſt walked, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.6. <hi>he that ſaith he abides in Chriſt, ought himſelf ſo to wolk, even as he walked;</hi> if you have the mind of Chriſt, you will abide in Chriſt, and Chriſt will abide in you; now if it be ſo, you muſt walk as Chriſt walked, and be in the world even as he was, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.17. <hi>becauſe as he is, ſo are we in this world.</hi> By theſe things you may know whether you have the mind of Chriſt, yea or no.</p>
               <p>In the next place, it is an uſe of exhortation to us, that we would be of Chriſts mind.</p>
               <p>Firſt, to thoſe that are of another mind; and Secondly, to thoſe that are of his mind, that they would be more and more of his mind.</p>
               <p>Firſt, to thoſe that are not of Chriſts mind; there are many in the world that are of other minds, of the Devils mind, of the worlds mind, and the fleſhes mind, froward minds, bitter minds, contentions minds, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.3. he ſhews you there what minds people are of, <hi>Among whom alſo we all had our Converſation in times paſt, in the luſts of our ſleſh, fulfilling the deſires of the fleſh, and of the mind, and were by nature the Children of wrath, even as others.</hi> We were in an ill condition, when we were of that mind, and did ſuch things; in <hi>James</hi> 3.14, 15. <hi>But if ye have bitter envying and ſtrife in your hearts, glory not, and lye not againſt the truth; this wiſdom deſcendeth not from above, but is earthly, ſenſual, Deviliſh. For where envying and ſtrife is, there is confuſion, and every evil work.</hi> If it be ſo, men have not Chriſts mind, and there is much envying,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:94121:86"/>and ſtrife and bitterneſs in the world in theſe dayes; O what double minds have men, what covetous minds, what proud minds, what hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical minds? if we have not the mind of Chriſt we are not true Chriſtians, and if we dye we ſhall periſh and be undone for ever.</p>
               <p>Well, how ſhall we get the mind of Chriſt?</p>
               <p>Firſt, lay down your own minds, &amp; wills, if you would have the will of Chriſt; if the Pitcher be full of muddy water, you cannot put in Wine, Milk, or Oyl, but you muſt empty the Pitcher before it can receive any of theſe Liquors; ſo if you would have the mind of Chriſt, you muſt emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty your ſelves of your own minds; look into 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. <hi>Let no man deceive himſelf, if any man among you ſeemeth to be wiſe in this world?</hi> you think you are wiſe, and have parts, and learning, and education (and the like;) they are good in their places, but they are nothing to the mind of Chriſt; but <hi>if any man ſeemeth to be wiſe in this world, let him become a fool that he may be wiſe.</hi> Our wiſdom is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity unto God, and till you have lay'd down your own wiſdom, you will never have the mind of Chriſt, nor the wiſdom of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if you would have the mind of Chriſt, give up your ſelves to be Diſciples of Chriſt; that is, ſearch the Scriptures, and ſtudy the Goſpel eſpecially, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. <hi>Search the Scriptures, they are they that teſtifie of me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, I come to thoſe that have ſomething of Chriſts mind, that they would la bour to have more of it, day by day. There is a natural deſire and itch in all men to know more and more: O that there might be ſuch a ſpiritual itch and deſire
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:94121:87"/>in you to know more of the mind of Jeſus Chriſt; <hi>Paul</hi> had it; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. <hi>We have the mind of Chriſt;</hi> yet ſaith he, <hi>I determined to know nothing</hi> among you, ſave Jeſus Chriſt, and him Crucified; his great deſire was to know Chriſt, and the mind of Chriſt, &amp; to have the knowledg of Jeſus Chriſt, for which he accounted all things but loſs and dung; O this is the onely knowledge, and the excellent know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and the ſoul-ſaving knowledge, and the ſoul comforting knowledge; to have the mind of Chriſt, and to know the things of Jeſus Chriſt, and he would have it more and more, though he knew it the moſt of, or more than all the men in the world did in that day.</p>
               <p>And why ſhould we labour to have more of this knowledge?</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe it is the end of the Miniſtry, and of the Goſpel; the Lord Chriſt hath given out or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances; a Church is an ordinance, and the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers are ordinances, and it is the end of them; look into 4 <hi>Eph.</hi> and ſee to what end they are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, <hi>v.</hi> 11.14. <hi>And he gave ſome Apoſtles, and ſome Prophets, and ſome Evangeliſts, and ſome Paſtors and Teachers, for the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the Miniſtry, for the edifying of the body of Chriſt, till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God.</hi> Mark, here's the <hi>knowledge</hi> of the Son of God, that's the mind of Chriſt, <hi>unto a perfect man, unto the meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſs of Chriſt; that we henceforth be no more Children, toſſed too and fro, and carried about <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ith every wind of Doctrine.</hi> Why? all the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and all the Officers in the Church, are for
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:94121:87"/>this end, to help you to come to the mind of Chriſt, to his mind, the fulneſs of it, the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of it; therefore as you would have the end accompliſhed, ſo labour to be more and more of the mind of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, you ſhould be ſo, becauſe it is the excellency of a Chriſtian to have the mind of Chriſt more and more; the more conſormable to Chriſt who is compleat and perfect, the more excellent you are; 'tis the very ſubſtance of a Chriſtian, to have his will, his thoughts, his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, his ends and aims to be the ſame with Chriſt; when I have Chriſts thoughts, and Chriſts will, and Chriſts underſtanding, and Chriſts affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and Chriſts ends, what a Chriſtian am I then? he is the moſt excellent Chriſtian, that hath moſt of the mind of Chriſt; therefore let us labour to know more of the mind of Chriſt, and to have Chriſts mind in us.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Laſtly, it is that which adds to your happineſs, it is a part of your happineſs here in this world to be of Chriſts mind. Wherein lay the happineſs of man and wom an at firſt, in the Image of God, and it lay in knowledge, and righteouſneſs, and holineſs; there was the Image of God. <hi>Adam</hi> was created an underſtanding, knowing man, a holy man, and a righteous man; now by <hi>Adam</hi>'s eating the forbidden fruit; this Image was loſt; but Chriſt he came to reſtore this again, it being loſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.24. <hi>And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and true holineſs.</hi> And in the <hi>Colloſſians, knowledge</hi> is mentioned, now by the Lord Jeſus Chriſt we have this reſtor'd again, and the more
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:94121:88"/>we know of Chriſts mind, the more that Image is renewed in us, 'tis a pure mind, an humble mind, a righteous mind, and it is an underſtanding mind; ſo that the more you know of Chriſt, the more purity, the more righteouſneſs, the more knowledge you have, and ſo the Image of God is renewed in you, and there's your happineſs; and when this comes to perfection, then you are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly happy, and that will be in heaven.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, what ſhould we do to get more of the mind of Chriſt into us?</p>
               <p>Firſt, if you would have more of the mind of Chriſt, then be you leſs conformable to the world be more and more off from the world, and o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> more and more transformed by the renewing of your minds, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.2. <hi>Be not conformed to this world, but be ye transtormed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and perfect will of God.</hi> You will come to know this good, and perfect, and acceptable will of God more and more; that is, the mind of Chriſt; 'tis the world keeps us from knowledge, the world doth blind us, and indiſpoſe us from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the divine truths and myſteries of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; that man that is moſt alienated from the world, and moſt contemplative of the Goſpel, will have moſt of the mind of God and Chriſt in him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if you would have more and more of the mind of Chriſt, ſee you love the Lord Jeſus Chriſt more and more daily. The more you love, the more Chriſt will let out his mind unto you, <hi>Job.</hi> 15.14, 15. <hi>Ye are my friends if ye do whatſoever I c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mmand you; henceforth I call you not Servants,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:94121:88"/>for the Servant knoweth not what his Lord doth; but I have called you friends, for all things that I have heard of my Father, I have made known unto you.</hi> Well, you are my friends, you love me, one friend loves another, and Chriſt made known all things unto them that he had received of his Father; ſo Chriſt will make all things known to your ſouls that he hath received of the Father, which is needful and good for you, if you love him; ſo in the 14. Ch. 21. <hi>he that hath my Commandments and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me, and he that loveth me, ſhall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt my ſelf to him.</hi> Would you have manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, ſecrets revealed unto you, and hidden things that the world knows not of, <hi>love</hi> the Lord Jeſus Chriſt more and more; a Wife the more ſhe loves her Husband, the more her Husband will communicate his ſecrets unto her; ſo the more you love Chriſt, the more of his mind ſhall you have communicated unto you.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Laſtly, if you would have more of the mind of Chriſt, then pray more and more for the ſpirit of Chriſt, for the ſpirit of Chriſt reveals the things of God, and ſearches them, and gives them out unto thoſe, where it is; pray unto Chriſt to fill you with his ſpirit, and that ſpirit will fill you with the knowledge of Chriſts mind; the ſpirit of God is a ſpirit of wiſdom and Revelation, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.14. <hi>the Spirit ſhall take of mine and ſhew un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you;</hi> there's a treaſury in Chriſt, <hi>in him are hid all the Treaſures of wiſdome and knowledge,</hi> and the ſpirit will take of Chriſts and ſhew unto you; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. laſt, <hi>we all with open face beholding as in a glaſs, the glory of the Lord, are changed into the ſame
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:94121:89"/>Image; from Glory to Glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.</hi> What's this <hi>Glaſs?</hi> the Goſpel is the glaſs, and in the glaſs there's Chriſt, and the mind of Chriſt, and when we come to look in there, we are changed into the ſame Image from glory to glory; we have more and more of the mind of Chriſt, and of the holineſs of Chriſt, and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Chriſt, <hi>as by the Spirit of the Lord;</hi> ſo that pray for the ſpirit, and the ſpirit will inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret and open the mind of Chriſt in all the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Goſpel, which are hidden from moſt men in the world.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>THis Chapter is full of exhortations; Firſt, general ones, to the end of my Text. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, particular ones, to the end of the Chapter.</p>
            <p>For the general ones, he exhorts them <hi>firſt,</hi> to ſeek the things which are above, and to ſet their affections on things above, <hi>v.</hi> 1, 2. which he preſſes with ſeveral Arguments to the beginning of the fifth verſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He exhorts them to mortification, in the fifth verſe. Mortifie your members which are upon the earth, Fornication, Uncleanneſs, Inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate affection, evil concupiſcence, and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, which is Idolatry. He exhorts them to mortifie all theſe earthly members, and gives rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and arguments for it, even to the twelfth verſe.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, He exhorts them to Chriſtian vertues, to Chriſtian practices, <hi>put</hi> on bowels of mercies, kindneſs, humbleneſs of mind, meekneſs, long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuffering, forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, and above all theſe things put on charity, which is the bond of perfectneſs, and let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which alſo you are called in one body, and be ye
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:94121:90"/>thankful; let the word of Chriſt dwell in you richly. Theſe be Chriſtian vertues, and Chriſtian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practices he puts them upon, and that by three Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments eſpecially.</p>
            <p>Firſt, from their election, put on as the <hi>elect of God;</hi> you are elect and choice veſſels of God, therefore put on theſe, they <hi>become</hi> elect ones. Secondly, you are <hi>holy,</hi> and 'tis not for holy ones to meddle with unholy things, but to do holily. Thirdly, you are beloved of God, God he loves you, and you are dear unto him, and therefore you ſhould look after ſuch virtues, and your pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices ſhould be accordingly; and then in the 17. verſe, he exhorts them <hi>to do all in the name of the Lord Jeſus.</hi> If you teach and admoniſh one another, if you ſing Pſalms, and Hymns, and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Songs; whatſoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jeſus: and then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards in the Chapter he comes to particular duties, of Wives to Husbands, and Husbands to Wives; of Children to Parents, and Parents to Children; of Servants to Maſters, and Maſters to Servants, and the like.</p>
            <p>In the words you may conſider; Firſt, the act, <hi>doing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, the extent of the act, <hi>whatſoever ye do in word, or deed, do all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, the manner, <hi>in the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here's nothing ſpoken of <hi>thoughts,</hi> are <hi>thoughts</hi> free therefore?</p>
            <p>Mens <hi>thoughts</hi> comprehend their reaſonings within, their conſultations, their deſires, their reſolutions, their intentions, which are all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:94121:90"/>here, being acts of the Mind, as well as the others are acts of the Tongue, and acts of the Hand; for <hi>thoughts</hi> are not free. We ſay, thoughts are free, free from man, he can take no Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance of them; but they are not free from the Lord, he knows them, and obſerves them; <hi>Why think ye evil in your hearts,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, and <hi>how long ſhall vain thoughts lodge within thee,</hi> O jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem? and, <hi>God will bring all ſecret things to light:</hi> but he doth not mention them, becauſe they are not obvious to others; but howſoever, they ſhould be ſuch as will ſuit with the name of Chriſt, and our <hi>thoughts</hi> ſhould be regulated and ordered an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerably; ſo as that they may be approved of him. They do principiate our words, and our actions, and are included in words and actions.</p>
            <p>But muſt all things be done in the name of Chriſt? whatſoever ye do in word or deed, let all be done in the name of Chriſt. What, ill as well as good, done in the name of Chriſt?</p>
            <p>No, he intends not any evil; for he writes to Chriſtians, and he writes to Saints, as you may ſee Ch. 1.2. <hi>To the Saints, and faithful Brethren in Chriſt.</hi> To Saints, and faithful Brethren he writes, and whatſoever <hi>they</hi> do in word or deed, <hi>they</hi> muſt do all in the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; they muſt have no ill thoughts in them, no ill words in their mouths, no evil deeds muſt iſſue from their hands; and in the Chapter he had exhorted them to mortifie their earthly members; therefore they are not to be entertained, nor to iſſue from them; and in 4. <hi>Phil.</hi> 8. he tells you there what are the things they ſhould think of, and ſo do, <hi>Finally Brethren, whatſoever things are true, whatſoever
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:94121:91"/>things are honeſt, whatſoever things are juſt, whatſoever things are pure, whatſoever things are lovely, whatſoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue in you, any grace</hi> in you, <hi>if there be any praiſe</hi> you aim at; <hi>think</hi> of theſe things, and <hi>ſpeak</hi> of theſe things, and <hi>do</hi> theſe things; theſe are the things that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ſhould <hi>think</hi> of, <hi>ſpeak,</hi> and <hi>do.</hi> The Doctrine which I ſhall commend to you is this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. That Chriſtians words and actions, ſhould all be done in the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; all that comes from a Chriſtian, ſhould be done in the name of the Lord Jeſus. <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.16. Chriſt faith, <hi>my Doctrine is not mine, but his that ſent me.</hi> 'Tis my Fathers, and I Preach in my Fathers name; and Chriſt taught them to pray in his name, <hi>whatſoever ye ſhall ask in my Name, I will give it you;</hi> and Chriſt ſent them to <hi>Preach in his name, Mat.</hi> 28. we are <hi>juſtified</hi> in the name of the Lord Jeſus, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. and we <hi>believe</hi> in the name of the Son, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.13. and Chriſtians muſt <hi>do all</hi> in the name of Jeſus Chriſt. Now here I muſt ſhew you.</p>
            <p>Firſt, what it is to do things in the name of the Lord Jeſus.</p>
            <p>Secondly, why we are to do all in the name of the Lord Jeſus.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, make the improvement of the point.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, what it is to do things in the name of the Lord Jeſus.</p>
            <p>By <hi>name,</hi> we underſtand Chriſt himſelf, (as the Scripture doth) Acts 4.12. <hi>There is no name, by which we can be ſaved, but by the name of Chriſt.</hi> But to do things in the name of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Firſt, is to have Authority and Commiſſion
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:94121:91"/>from Chriſt, to do what we do, to do them in the authority of Chriſt, by Commiſſion from Chriſt, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.6. Now we command you Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, <hi>in the name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> that is, in the authority of Chriſt, by Commiſſion from Chriſt; ſo that when we do things by Commiſſion from Chriſt, by the authority of Chriſt, we are ſaid to do things in his name. In <hi>Luke</hi> 9.49. we ſaw one caſting out Devils <hi>in thy name;</hi> that is, by authority and commiſſion from thee, pretended at leaſt, if not real; and <hi>Mark</hi> 11.9. Bleſſed is he that cometh <hi>in the name</hi> of the Lord; that is, he that comes authorized from the Lord, furniſhed with gifts and abilities for the work that he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes, that comes in the name of the Lord, by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine authority; falſe Prophets they came in their own names, they came not in the name of the Lord, and therefore the Lord declares his anger againſt them, and threatens them; they had no authority, no commiſſion for what they did; ſo that thats the firſt thing, to do in the name of the Lord Jeſus, is to do it by his authority.</p>
            <p>Secondly, To do in the name of the Lord Jeſus, is to do it by the ſtrength of Chriſt, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44.5. <hi>In,</hi> or <hi>through thy name,</hi> will we tread them under that riſe up againſt us. There are many that riſe up againſt us, and fight, and think to prevail and carry all, and to bear us down, but <hi>in thy name</hi> will we tread them under; that is, by thy help, and by thy power, and by thy ſtrength we will tread them under; ſo in 10. <hi>Luke</hi> 17. and the ſeventy returned again with joy; ſaying, Lord, even the Devils are ſubject unto us <hi>through thy name;</hi> through the power, and ſtrength of thy name we
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:94121:92"/>prevail againſt Devils, they are ſubject unto us; and that in 3. <hi>Acts</hi> 6. where the Apoſtle ſaith to the impotent man, <hi>in the name of Jeſus Chriſt of Nazareth,</hi> riſe up and walk; that is, by the power and ſtrength of Jeſus Chriſt riſe up and walk: The name of Chriſt there, notes the power and ſtrength of Chriſt; ſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 71.16. I will go <hi>in the ſtrength</hi> of the Lord: when we go in the <hi>ſtrength</hi> of the Lord, we go in the <hi>name</hi> of the Lord, and that <hi>David</hi> makes evident, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.45. when he went againſt <hi>Goliah,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I come to thee in the name of the Lord of Hoſts:</hi> thou comeſt in thy own ſtrength, but I come in the ſtrength of the Lord of Hoſts to fight with thee, and ſo he prevailed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. Hence ſaith the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1. my Son, <hi>be ſtrong in the grace that is in Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> dont reſt upon the grace that is in thy ſelf, but be ſtrong in the grace that is in Chriſt; when we act in the ſtrength of the grace of Chriſt, then we act in the name of Chriſt, when we lean upon him for ſtrength, and confide not in our ſelves; this is doing in his name.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, To act in the name of Chriſt, is to do things in the ſtead of Chriſt, in the very place of Chriſt; when Judges act in the name of the King, they do all in his ſtead, in his room, in his place, in <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.19. I will raiſe you up a Prophet like unto <hi>Moſes;</hi> and whoſoever will not hearken un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the words he ſhall ſpeak <hi>in my name,</hi> I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it of him. It's ſpoken of Chriſt, who was the Prophet to be raiſed up in the room of <hi>Moſes;</hi> and ſaith God, whoſoever will not hearken to what he ſhall ſpeak in my name, in my ſtead, I will require it of him; what Chriſt did, was in
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:94121:92"/>the Fathers ſtead, they were his words he ſpake, his works that he did; ſo that to <hi>do in the name of Chriſt,</hi> is to do as Chriſt himſelf would do; as if Chriſt were preſent, to do what Chriſt would do, and ſpeak what Chriſt would ſpeak, and think what the Lord Chriſt would think, that's to do things in his name, in his ſtead.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, to do things in the name of Chriſt, is to do them according to the will of Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.23. compared with the 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.14. <hi>Whatſoever ye ſhall ask in my name, ſhall be given unto you;</hi> now in 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.14. ſaith <hi>John</hi> who was the beloved Diſciple, and told you Chriſts words in the Goſpel, he interprets them here, and tells you, this is the confidence that we have in him, that if we ask any thing <hi>according to his will,</hi> he heareth us. What is according to his will, is in his name; whatſoever we ask, or whatſoever we do, according to the will of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; that is, in the name of Chriſt, and ſo the propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>En</hi> is taken in Scripture, for <hi>according; Joh.</hi> 3.21. he that doth the truth, cometh to the light; that his deeds may be made manifeſt, that they are wrought <hi>in God;</hi> that is, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God, according to the will of God. Men don't properly do their works <hi>in God,</hi> but accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the will and mind of God; ſo that when we do act, either in word or deed according to the will of Chriſt, then we do things in the name of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, to do all in the name of Chriſt, is to do all for the ſake of Chriſt; ſo you will find the name of Chriſt to be taken, <hi>Mark</hi> 9.37. who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhall receive one ſuch Child <hi>in my name,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:94121:93"/>me; that is, whoſoever receiveth one of ſuch Children for my name ſake, receiveth me; ſo in the 41 <hi>v.</hi> whoſoever ſhall give you a cup of water to drink <hi>in my name,</hi> that is, for my ſake; ſo that to do things for the ſake of Chriſt, is to do things in the name of Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.12. I kept them <hi>in thy name,</hi> that is, for thy ſake; in 4. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. I therefore the Priſoner <hi>of</hi> the Lord, a Priſoner <hi>in</hi> the Lord, ſaith your Margin; but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, 'tis a Priſoner <hi>for</hi> the Lord, 'tis for the Lords ſake that I am a Priſoner; ſo that to do things in the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, is to do them for his ſake; and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is of the ſame force with other Prepoſitions; as, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, ye ſhall be hated of all Nations <hi>for</hi> my ſake, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.9. and ſo in <hi>Acts</hi> 9.16. how great things he muſt ſuffer, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>for</hi> my name. And in the 19 <hi>Mat.</hi> 29. he that hath forſaken houſes, or any thing, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>for</hi> my name ſake; ſo then to do things <hi>in the name of Chriſt,</hi> is to do them for Chriſts ſake; as when Beggars do beg of you for Chriſts ſake to beſtow an alms upon them, if you give them an Alms for Chriſts ſake, that's in the name of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, to do things in the name of Chriſt, is to do them to the honour and glory of his name, to do them to Chriſts account; ſo that Chriſt may not be damnified, nor ſuffer any way, but that Chriſts name may be honoured, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.7. ſaith the Apoſtle, as ye abound in every thing, in faith, in utterance, in knowledge, and in your <hi>love to us,</hi> the Greek is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> your love towards us; ſo that the prepoſition <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> there, ſignifies <hi>towards:</hi> So here, to do all in the name of Chriſt, is to do all towards
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:94121:93"/>Chriſt, towards the honouring of Chriſt, ſuitable to that in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatſoever ye do, <hi>do all to the glory of God;</hi> do all to the glory of his name, do all to the manifeſtation of Chriſt and his name, let our words, and actions be ſuch as may hold forth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Chriſt, hold forth the name of Chriſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Antipas</hi> did hold faſt the <hi>name of Chriſt,</hi> the truths of Chriſt, the graces of Chriſt, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Chriſts Doctrine, and <hi>Acts</hi> 9.15. Go thy way, for he is a choſen veſſel unto me, <hi>to bear my name before the Gentiles, and Kings, and the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of</hi> Iſrael; he muſt hold forth my name, and declare ſomething of me that may be for my ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and glory; it's ſaid in 2 <hi>Phil.</hi> 16. <hi>holding forth the word of life;</hi> when we hold forth the word of life, we hold forth the name of Chriſt, and this is for the honour of Chriſt, when Chriſtians hold forth Chriſts meekneſs, Chriſts humility, Chriſts patience, Chriſts love, any truth of Chriſt, any thing of Chriſt, then they do things in the name of Chriſt, they do honour and glorifie Chriſt, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.25. if one come into the Church that believeth not, or one unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all, and the ſecre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s of his heart are made manifeſt, and ſo <hi>falling down upon his face, he will worſhip God, and report that God is in you of a truth:</hi> They held forth ſomething of God, they held forth the name of God, and God was glorified, and a heathen, or a ſtranger coming in, ſaith, of a truth God is in you. Chriſts works de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the Father to be in him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.10.11. <hi>The Father that dwelleth in me, he doth the works, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me that I am in the Father, and the Father in
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:94121:94"/>me, or elſe believe me for the very works ſake.</hi> The works that I do, do hold forth the Father, why they are done in the Fathers name, and he is glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified by the works that I do; and Chriſt glorified his Father here on earth, by doing of his Fathers will, and his Fathers works.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, Laſtly, to do things in the name of Chriſt, is to do them by invocating of Chriſt, by invocating of the name of Chriſt; and ſo <hi>Beza,</hi> and <hi>Zanchy</hi> and others interpret this place; <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.20. <hi>where two or three are gathered together in my name;</hi> that is, invocating of me, calling upon my name; to call upon the Lord for coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, for direction, for our thoughts, for our words, for our actions, this is doing things in the name of Chriſt. It was the practice of the Saints to do ſo, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.2. unto the Church of God which is at <hi>Corinth,</hi> to them that are ſanctified in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, called to be Saints, with all that in every place <hi>call upon the name of Jeſus Chriſt our Lord;</hi> they called upon the name of Jeſus Chriſt, to have councel, and direction, and advice from him, for their words, and actions, and all their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings. So in 9. <hi>Acts</hi> 14. we hear he hath autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity from the chief Prieſts, to bind all <hi>that call on thy n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>me.</hi> The Chriſtians called on the name of the Lord Jeſus, for advice and councel, and they were queſtioned, and perſecuted, and troubled for it. So then you ſee what it is to do things in the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond thing is, why are we to do things in the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Firſt, becauſe we are impotent of our ſelves, and can neither think, nor ſpeak, nor do any
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:94121:94"/>thing of our ſelves well, that is ſpiritual, and truly good, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Not that we are ſufficient of our ſelves to think any thing as of our ſelves:</hi> What <hi>Paul,</hi> that great Apoſtle, that great Schollar, not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient of himſelf to think any thing as of himſelf? No, ſaith he, we are not ſufficient of our ſelves, but our ſufficiency is of God, and <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.5. <hi>without me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt <hi>ye can do nothing,</hi> abſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from me, ye can do nothing, take the branch from the Vine, and it will not grow, it will not be green, nor bring forth any cluſters, ſo aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated, diſtanced from Chriſt, we can do nothing; no ſpiritual action, no ſpiritual thought, no ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual word; and <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.13. ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> there, <hi>I can do all things through Chriſt that ſtrengthens wit.</hi> I can think good thoughts, ſpeak gracious words, do heavenly actions, I can do any thing through Chriſt that ſtrengthens me. Therefore we ſhould do all in Chriſts name, that ſo we may have ſtrength from Chriſt, to do what we do, to do it well, to do it ſpiritually.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we ſhould do all in the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, becauſe we do all bear that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and worthy name of Chriſt, we are called Chriſtians, in the 11 of the <hi>Acts,</hi> at <hi>Antioch</hi> they had that name put upon them, <hi>James</hi> 2.7. Do not they blaſpheme that <hi>worthy name by the which ye are called:</hi> Men can blaſpheme and diſhonour the name of Chriſt by their own corruptions, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt power and ſtrength they have, but to honour the name of Chriſt they cannot; now its <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a good name, an honourable name, a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious name, a great name, the name of the Lord Jeſus, by which we are all called, we are called
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:94121:95"/>
               <hi>Chriſtians, Iſa.</hi> 4.7. in that day, ſeven women ſhall take hold of one man, ſaying, <hi>&amp;c. onely let us be called by thy name;</hi> they deſir'd it, and yet went without it, ſuch a ſcarcity there was of men; but Chriſts name is put upon us all, therefore we ſhould do, and ſpeak in the name of Chriſt, whoſe name we bear; thoſe that were <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> Diſciples, did things in his name; and ſo thoſe were <hi>Plato</hi>'s, did things in his name; and ſo we being Chriſtians, ſhould do all things in the name of Chriſt, in 2 <hi>Tit.</hi> 10. the Apoſtle there ſpeaks to Servants, <hi>that they may adorn the Doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.</hi> Why, <hi>the Doctrine,</hi> is the <hi>name of Chriſt,</hi> the Goſpel is the name of Chriſt, and as ſervants ſhould adorn the Doctrine of God our Saviour in all things, ſo ſhould we adorn his Doctrine, adorn his name in all things; and in all things we <hi>think, ſpeak,</hi> or <hi>do,</hi> we ſhould make his name honourable and glorious, and dreadful too: <hi>John</hi> was a holy man, and adorned the name of Chriſt, and he ſtruck a dread into <hi>Herod</hi> by his Holineſs, he feared him, he was a holy man.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, we ſhould do all things in the name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, becauſe this will warrant our actions, and ſecure them. Thoſe who keep courts in their own names, what ſtumbling is there at it, and quarrelling againſt them; ſo when we do things in our own names, there will be quarrelling at it: But Judges and Juſtices that do all in the Kings name, this bears them out, they do it in the Kings name; ſo when we do things in Chriſts name, this will warrant us: There be three things that do concur to good actions.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that the principle whence they come
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:94121:95"/>be good; now if we do invocate the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt (which is one way of doing things in his name) its an argument we have a good principle, we begin with Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that the end be right, we muſt have a right end in a good action, there muſt be the glory of God, and the glory of Chriſt, and how can it be otherwiſe, if we do all in the Name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; If we do all <hi>in</hi> his name, we ſhall do all <hi>unto</hi> his name, and all <hi>for</hi> his name, for the honour of his name, and ſo far we are well.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, but then where the great and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon failing of men and women is, they fail in the manner, and if we fail there, our action is marr'd, and it is not acceptable, it is not a good action, and the manner muſt be in the name of the Lord Jeſus, whatſoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jeſus, do all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his will, do all for his ſake, do all in his ſtrength; it muſt be in a right manner, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it will not be a good action, if we do it in Chriſts name, it will bear us up, and bear us out; and if we ſhould ſuffer, it will bear up us, and we ſhall have this comfort in it, that we ſuffer for Chriſts ſake, and not for our own ſakes, or for mens ſakes; and if men wrong us, they wrong the Lord Chriſt, when we do things in his name, and according to his will; when it is done in our own names, we muſt ſtand to it our ſelves, and bear it out as well as we can; but if it be done in his name, he will bear us out.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, we ſhould do all in the name of the Lord Jeſus, becauſe we are all bought by the Lord Jeſus, and are not our own; it's ſaid in <hi>Peter,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:94121:96"/>they deny the Lord that bought them,</hi> i. e. Chriſt the Lord hath bought all to be <hi>Sons</hi> or Slaves; but for Chriſtians, and thoſe that are Saints, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. laſt, <hi>Ye are not your own, for ye are bought with a price, therefore glorifie God in your body, and in your ſpirit, which are Gods.</hi> We are bought, and bought by Chriſt, and therefore we ſhould do all in the name of Chriſt, being he hath bought us for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; Servants ſhould do all in their Maſters names, nothing in their own names; they in the 12. <hi>Pſal.</hi> cryed, our Tongues are our own, we will ſpeak what we liſt; they thought their tongues, their hands, their feet, their eyes, and all their own, when as nothing was their own, the worſt man that is hath nothing his own, for he is bought by Chriſt to be a Slave or a Servant; as a man that buys the Vineyard, he buys the dry ſticks as well as the Vine, and the dry ſticks for the good of the Vines; ſo the Lord hath bought all, but the Godly in a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar manner, to do all in his name, for his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and glory.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, we ſhould do all in the name of the Lord Jeſus; if we conſider the near relation we are in to Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Firſt, we are members of his body; true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers are members of the body of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and every member ſhould act for the head, and do all in the name of the head.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we are ſubjects to Chriſt, he is their King, and they muſt do all in the name of the King; Subjects muſt act as Subjects, in the name of the King, and we as Chriſts Subjects muſt act in Chriſts name, he is our King, our Soveraign, and our Commander.</p>
            <pb n="185" facs="tcp:94121:96"/>
            <p> Thirdly, we are the Spouſe of Chriſt, and the Spouſe muſt do all in the name of her Husband, what ſhe doth in her own name will not be war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable in Law; ſo what we do will not be war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable in the Court of Heaven, if it be not done in the name of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Laſtly, we ſhould do all in the name of the Lord Jeſus, becauſe this is to live a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian life indeed; 'tis ſaid of all men, that in God they live and move, all men in the common providence of God, they live and move, but Chriſtians live in Chriſt, he is their life, and hence <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>I live not, but Chriſt lives in me;</hi> I do not live as a man, or as a learned man, or as a Phariſee, but I live as a Chriſtian; I live, nay Chriſt lives in me, I dont live upon the account of a learned man, or a natural man (and the like) but Chriſt lives in me, and I live in him, in his life, in his ſtrength, in his will, in his mind; as a ſervant, a true ſervant, when he comes to a houſe where he is to be a Servant, he muſt lay down his own will and mind, and his own hands and feet, he muſt do nothing now in his own name and ſtrength; but he muſt live in his Maſters will, and in his Maſters Commands, and in his Maſters authority; ſo a Chriſtian, he lives in Chriſt, when we lay down our own wills, and reaſons (and the like) and make the reaſon, and end of all we do to be Chriſt; then are we Chriſtians indeed; Chriſts reaſon is my reaſon, Chriſts will is my will, Chriſts glory is my end, Chriſts word is my rule; this now is true living the life of a Chriſtian: thus you ſee ſeveral reaſons why we ſhould do all in the name of Jeſus Chriſt. I ſhall now come
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:94121:97"/>to ſome inferences, or improvements of the point.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Inf.</hi> Firſt, if we are to do all in the name of the Lord Jeſus, then I infer from hence, here's matter of humiliation to us all, we have great cauſe to be humbled every one of us, not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we have done evil (which calls for humbling to) or becauſe we have neglected good (which calls for humbling alſo) but humbled becauſe we have done good, done good the wrong way, done good in our own names, in our own ſtrength, and not in the name of the Lord Jeſus? who is there among us that can ſay he hath <hi>done</hi> and <hi>ſpoken</hi> all in the name of the Lord Jeſus: many talk they have done this good, and that good, but tell me, haſt thou done it in the name of the Lord Jeſus? if it ſhall be weighed in the ballance of the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, there will be defects found, and thy ſelf will be too light, and thy beſt actions will be defective and imperfect, and call upon thee to be humbled even for thy righteouſneſs; for Preaching, for Praying, for Hearing, for breaking bread, for alms, for all that ever we do; there will be ſuch gaps, and ſuch gulfs and failings, as we have cauſe to be aſhamed even of our righteouſneſs, ſaith the Prophet, <hi>all our Righteouſneſſes are as filthy Rags;</hi> what, filthy Rags thy righteouſneſs? yea, all our righteouſneſſes as filthy Rags; why? filthy Rags defile us; many think, O their good works do purifie and cleanſe them, and anſwer for their ſins; and are meritorious (and the like) no, our beſt works do defile us, becauſe there are ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects in them, and eſpecially when they are not done in the name of the Lord Jeſus, according to
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:94121:97"/>his will, and in his ſtrength, and for his honour and glory; we have no cauſe then of being ſwell'd and puffed up with conceits of what we have done, or ever ſhall do.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if all muſt be done in word and deed, in the name of the Lord Jeſus; then I infer, that no thoughts, no words, no actions, are to be conceived, uttered or done, which are not autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized by the Lord Jeſus, which are not according to his will, which Chriſt himſelf would not think and ſpeak, and do; none ſhould be uſed by us, which dont manifeſt ſomething of Jeſus Chriſt, which tend not to the glory of his name, which we dare not pray unto him to give a bleſſing unto; we have many vile thoughts in us, &amp; many fooliſh words in our mouths, and many acts are done which we dare hardly look up to Chriſt and ſay, Lord bleſs this thought, or Lord bleſs this word, or Lord bleſs this act, all ſuch thoughts, words, and acts therefore are to be laid by; you know what he ſaith here in the Chapter before, <hi>Mortifie your members which are upon the earth, fornication, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs, inordinate affection, evil concupiſcence:</hi> all our affections they ſhould be look'd well unto, and we ſhould have no affection, but that we may look unto Chriſt for a bleſſing upon it? and ſo all the reſt. What abundance of fears are in men and women, which they dare not look up to Chriſt to bleſs thoſe fears? they may look up to him to <hi>ſcatter</hi> thoſe fears, but not to <hi>bleſs</hi> them; we ſhould be in the <hi>fear of the Lord</hi> all the day, a Godly fears ſo, what doubts have we about the Scriptures, about the Trinity, about our ſalvation, about our eſtate and condition; but they are not ſuch as are war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:94121:98"/>by Chriſt, and for his honour and glory. Thoſe that pray to Saints, do they do it in the name of the Lord Jeſus. So thoſe that worſhip and adore Images, how dare they do it in the name of Chriſt? ſo thoſe that bow to an Altar, how dare they do it in the name of Chriſt? ſo thoſe worſhip the Bread, how dare they do it in the name of Chriſt; Chriſt never will approve of ſuch kind of actions, or thoughts tending to ſuch wayes and practices. Whatever therefore is not according to Chriſt, and may not be done in the name of the Lord Jeſus, which Chriſt would not do, we ſhould not dare to think, ſpeak, or do.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, See hence two great evils among men, even good men, and good women.</p>
            <p>Firſt, we may ſee here, why many ſo oft miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry in their undertakings, they do not what they do in word or deed in the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, they do things in their own names, and in their own ſtrength, and according to their own wills, and for their own glory; ſo <hi>Judas</hi> did all in his own name, and for himſelf, and not for Chriſt, he had a covetous heart. So <hi>Annanias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> miſcarried, they did things in their own name; ſo <hi>Demas</hi> he did things in his own name, the world was ſtill upon him, and he miſcarried; and Godly men and women they miſcarry; they begin not with Chriſt, they do not things in the name of Chriſt, they do not do things for Chriſt, and therefore they miſcarry fearfully, becauſe Chriſt is not taken along with them: This is a <hi>true</hi> cauſe, if not the <hi>onely</hi> cauſe, why Saints and precious ones miſcarry in their actions.</p>
            <p>Secondly, ſee hence why Godly men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:94121:98"/>have ſo much guilt and fear upon their ſpirits, which appears in ill times, eſpecially when Gods judgments are abroad, and dangers are at hand; Oh how guilty are they! how fearful are they? what's the reaſon of this? it's becauſe the thoughts, and words, and actions, have not been in the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; we have thought our own thoughts, and ſpoke our own words, and done our own wills, and hence it comes to paſs that we are full of guilt, and full of fear, in 12. <hi>Mat.</hi> 36. <hi>I ſay unto you, that every idle word that men ſhall ſpeak, they ſhall give account thereof in the day of Judgment.</hi> God hath many dayes of judgment here in the world, before the great day of judgment here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after; <hi>For by thy words thou ſhalt be juſtified, and by thy words thou ſhalt be condemned.</hi> Our <hi>words</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn us, and we find guilt upon us for our words, and our <hi>actions</hi> do condemn us, and we find guilt upon us for our actions, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.7, 8. <hi>Who will render to every man according to his deeds, to them who by patient continuance in well doing, ſeek for glory, and honour, and immortality, eternal life; but unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteouſneſs, indignation, and wrath, tribulation and anguiſh upon every ſoul of man that doth evil, of the Jew firſt, and alſo of the Gentile:</hi> We find fears, and we fear tribulation, and fear ruine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, becauſe our actions have not been done in the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, for his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and glory, but for our ſelves.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, if Chriſtians muſt do all in the name of the Lord Jeſus, then nothing is to be done in but own names, to do things in our own names, is not currant, is not legal, is not warrantable,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:94121:99"/>who authorized you will Chriſt ſay, to do this or that in your own name? what warrant have you? what word have you for it, to do it in your own name? no, neither muſt we do things in our own ſtrength, nor in our own wiſdom, we think we are wiſe, and we are able; but <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.5, 6, 7. <hi>Lean not unto thine own underſtanding:</hi> dont lean to thy own underſtanding, thou art but a fool unto God, and thy wiſdom is nothing, lean not to thine own underſtanding; <hi>in all thy wayes acknowledge him.</hi> Mark, in all thy wayes acknowledge him, look up to him, do things in his name, by his wiſdom, by his ſtrength, not by thy own, <hi>and he ſhall direct thy path;</hi> is not Gods direction better than our own? Gods councel better than ours? Gods ſtrength better than ours, lean not then to your own wiſdom, acknowledge him in all your wayes, <hi>be not wiſe in thine own eyes.</hi> We are loth to lay down our own wiſdom, and our own appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions and conceptions, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.4. <hi>Labour not to be rich, ceaſe from thine own wiſdom;</hi> make not that thy deſign, I will be rich, and like the great ones in the City, and I will be high, and I will be ſo and ſo; this is thy own wiſdom, thy own folly indeed, we are not to do any thing in our own names, no nor in the name of Angels, nor of Saints; the Papiſts do many things in the name of this Saint, and the other Saint, and in the name of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> they do many things, pray in her name, and act in her name, and ſuffer in her name; but this is not in the name of Chriſt, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jeſus. Therefore remember we are to do nothing in our own names, or in the names
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:94121:99"/>of any, but in the name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, I infer hence, that whoſoever would ſteer a right courſe in this world, and have his thoughts, words, and actions accepted, and bleſſed, muſt have a ſpecial eye unto the Lord Chriſt; we muſt look to him as the Pole-ſtar, as Marriners, their eye is much upon the Pole-ſtar, or the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs upon which they ſail by, their eye is upon theſe, otherwiſe they will go out of their way, and miſcarry: but if we obſerve the courſes of men and women, they ſail moſt by the compaſs of the world, look what the world doth, and ſuch and ſuch a man doth, that they will do; or if not ſo, yet by the cuſtome of places where they are, why 'tis the cuſtom of the place to do thus and thus, or elſe according to the tradition of the Elders, our Elders did ſo, they waſh'd their hands before meat, and we will do it, or elſe they look to the Laws of men. But this is not yet in the name of Chriſt, or elſe they do things by their own wills, and luſts; they will have theſe fulfilled, but where's the name of Chriſt all this while? men go wrong, and out of the way, not looking at Chriſt, few direct their courſe by Chriſt, his name, his councel, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his will, and his word. It was other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe with that bleſſed Apoſtle <hi>Paul, Paul</hi> had his eye upon Chriſt; therefore he ſaith in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.1. <hi>Be ye followers of me, as I am of Chriſt,</hi> I have Chriſt alwayes in my eye, I begin with Chriſt, I go on with Chriſt, I end with Chriſt, I have Chriſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in my eye; dont follow me at all, if I dont follow Chriſt; I am a learned man, and you think you may follow me becauſe I am a learned
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:94121:100"/>man; or I am an Apoſtle, and you will follow me therefore; but if I dont follow Chriſt, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding my learning, and my Apoſtleſhip, dont follow me; it is Chriſt you muſt have in your eye, it is Chriſt you muſt regulate all by, he muſt be your Pole ſtar, he muſt be your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs; ſo in 5 <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. <hi>Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear Children:</hi> dont follow the world, dont follow the cuſtomes of places, dont follow any but <hi>God,</hi> and be followers of God <hi>as dear Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;</hi> Children will follow their Parents, and follow no others. So then, if we would ſteer our courſe aright, we muſt be followers of Chriſt, and eye Chriſt, and eye God, and take up all from them, and not from men.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, if we muſt do all in the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt (according as we have opened) then here ſee to whom we owe the ſucceſs of all we do, 'tis not to our ſelves, 'tis not to ſecond cauſes, it is to the L. C. that we owe the ſucceſs of all, when we do things in his name, and for his ſake he doth bleſs them, and give ſucceſs to our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, when we begin with Chriſt, and take Chriſt along with us, and do all as we ought to do, then Chriſt bleſſes, and then he gives ſucceſs. When we pray in Chriſts name, he tells us God will give, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.23. ſo in 4 <hi>Eph.</hi> laſt, <hi>even as God for Chriſts ſake hath forgiven you,</hi> for <hi>Chriſts ſake</hi> it is. If we pray, and beg pardon, 'tis for Chriſts ſake we have our prayers heard, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don given in, and whatſoever attempts you make, and ſucceſs you have. If you do it in the name of Chriſt, it is for his ſake you have the bleſſing; therefore dont ſay it is your endeavours, and your
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:94121:100"/>contrivance, and diligence, and care, and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection; no, it is for the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, 'tis he that gives the ſucceſs, and the bleſſing.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, if we muſt do all in the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, then let us examine, we who are Chriſtians, and bear the name of Chriſt, let us examine whether we do all in the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, it's good to know in whoſe name you do your actions.</p>
            <p>You will ſay, how ſhall we know that?</p>
            <p>You may know it by what I have ſaid already; do you do all in the authority of Chriſt, in the ſtrength of Chriſt, in the ſtead of Chriſt, do you do all according to the will of Chriſt, for the ſake of Chriſt, for the honour of Chriſt, by invocating of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; then you do it in his name. But to add ſome few things more.</p>
            <p>Firſt, you may know it by this, if you do things in Chriſts name, then you do conſult much with the Lord Chriſt, and take counſel from him, and from his word, you will not truſt your own heads, nor truſt your own hearts, <hi>he that truſteth in his own heart is a fool,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> and we have many ſuch fools in the world, <hi>ſound wiſdom and Counſel are mine,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.14. None can give you ſound wiſdom, and ſound councel, but my ſelf; now do you go to Chriſt for coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, do you adviſe with him, and conſult with him, it's an Argument then you do things in his name, <hi>David</hi> in the 119. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 24. ſaith, <hi>Thy Teſtimonies art my delight, and my Councellors;</hi> I delight in thy Teſtimonies, and they are my Councellors, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult with thy word, the word of God, the word of Chriſt, I conſult with that, and I do all accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:94121:101"/>thereunto; therefore he is ſaid to be a man <hi>fulfilling all the wills of God,</hi> he took advice from Gods word, he went to Chriſt who gave him ſound wiſdom, and ſound Councel, but if we go about our actions, and do our own wills, and never ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe with Chriſt, we go in our own ſtrength, and the iſſue is not like to be ſucceſsful.</p>
            <p>Secondly, you ſhall know it hereby, they that do all in the name of the Lord Jeſus, they advance him, and make him high, and lay themſelves low; whoſe name ſoever things are done in, they are advanced, if we do things in our own names, we advance our ſelves; if we do things in the names of men, we advance men; but if we do things in Chriſts name, we advance the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; when Servants do things in their own names, they ſpoil all, then their Maſters are laid low; but when they do all in the name of their Maſters, then their Maſters are exalted. Now ask your ſouls, what advancement Chriſt hath from your thoughts, words, or actions, ſaith <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 71.16. <hi>I will go in the ſtrength of the Lord God,</hi> and <hi>I will make mention of thy righteouſneſs, even of thine onely.</hi> I'le go in thy ſtrength, that is, in thy name; every attribute is his name, as I told you, to go in the name of Chriſt, is to go in the ſtrength of Chriſt: now ſaith he, I will go in the ſtrength of the Lord God, I will make mention of thy righteouſneſs, even of thine onely; I will exalt thy name, and thy righteouſneſs, and exalt thine onely; do you therefore go out in the ſtrength of Chriſt, and exalt his righteouſneſs onely, his name onely, his truths onely, his ordinances onely; <hi>Paul</hi> did ſo, in 15 <hi>Rom.</hi> 18. <hi>For I will not dare to ſpeak of any of
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:94121:101"/>thoſe things, which Chriſt hath not wrought by me, to make the Gentiles obedient by word and deed.</hi> Have the Gentiles been brought in, are they obedient in <hi>word?</hi> are they obedient in <hi>deed?</hi> 'tis not my work, but the work of Jeſus Chriſt, I will not dare to ſpeak of any thing is mine; but I will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ſpeak of the work of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, thus he advances Chriſt. So that if you do things in the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, you will advance Chriſt, and lift him up, and it's no matter who goes down, ſo he goes up; ſo did <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, he muſt increaſe, I muſt decreaſe, and it matters not, for I am not worthy to looſe the Latchet of his Shoes, ſo excellent is he.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, whoſoever doth all in the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, his name is not onely an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centive to action, but an attractive to action, for as there is <hi>power</hi> in his name; ſo there is <hi>love</hi> in the name of Chriſt; the <hi>power</hi> of that name will bind the heart to obedience, but the love that is in the name, doth work complacency in the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; it works complacency and delight, as in the name; ſo in the obedience that is given to that name; he makes it his incentive, and faith, the work is neceſſary and muſt be done; but the other that finds it an attractive faith, the work is good, and I will do it. I muſt do this, and I muſt do that, ſaith one; but ſaith another, the work is good, and I will do it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.28. <hi>It's good</hi> for me to draw nigh to God: He dont ſay, 'tis my duty, 'tis neceſſary, but it's good for me, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to draw near to God: So that if we do all in the name of Chriſt, we ſhall find the name of Chriſt an attractive, to draw our hearts to do things with delight and pleaſure.</p>
            <pb n="196" facs="tcp:94121:102"/>
            <p> Fourthly, You ſhall know it hereby, for he that doth all in the name of Chriſt, makes that name the ground and pillar for a bleſſing upon his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: when I <hi>ſpeak</hi> in the name of Chriſt, or <hi>act</hi> in the name of Chriſt, I make the name of Chriſt, the pillar and the ground of my hope for a bleſſing upon what I <hi>ſay,</hi> or what I <hi>do.</hi> It is not the goodneſs of my action, which is the ground of my hope; a man may be importunate in Prayer, and be zealous, and pray very well, but he dont make this the ground of his hope. A man may be very ſollid in Preaching, and very ſerious in Hearing; but this muſt not be the ground of his hope for a bleſſing upon the action; but the ground of his hope is from the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.3. becauſe of the ſavour of thy good Oyntments, <hi>Thy name is as an Oyntment pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forth;</hi> That perfumes all the actions done in Chriſts name, and ſo they are acceptable unto God, and this name is the ground of my hope for a bleſſing from God, and from Chriſt, becauſe I look at the name of Chriſt, which is the ſweet Oyntment that doth perfume all. Therefore ask your hearts, what's the ground and the Pillar of your hopes for a bleſſing upon your actions; 'tis not the goodneſs of your actions, but the name of Chriſt that gives the hope.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Laſtly, he that doth all in the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, aſcribes the bleſſing and ſucceſs of all unto the name of Chriſt, he will at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute nothing to his own thoughts, words, or actions; he will attribute nothing to any inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening cauſe, but attribute all unto the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 115.1. <hi>Not unto us, O Lord,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:94121:102"/>not unto us,</hi> away with all that ſhould riſe from us; <hi>but unto thy name give glory,</hi> yea, <hi>all</hi> the glory; 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12. <hi>I thank Jeſus Chriſt our Lord,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, that inabled me, and put me into the Miniſtry.</hi> He gives the glory to Chriſt, I thank the Lord, I had no power to Preach, but thou haſt enabled me to Preach, and I give thee the glory; ſo did <hi>Pet.</hi> 2 <hi>E.</hi> 3.18. <hi>To him be glory both now and for ever A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi> To him be the glory that makes known him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unto us, that gives grace unto us, that inables us to Preach and Pray, and do good in our places and generations, and callings, to <hi>him</hi> be glory both now and for ever. So <hi>John,</hi> in 1. <hi>Rev. to him</hi> be glory and dominion for ever and ever. The ſoul that doth all in the name of Chriſt, will ſee infinite reaſon why Chriſt ſhould have all the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and all the honour; do you ſo give <hi>him</hi> all, and challenge nothing to your ſelves, attribute no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to your own dregs, to your own endeavours, to your own actings, it's a ſign you do all in the name of Chriſt then.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, Laſtly, muſt Chriſtians do all in the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt? then it ſerves to be an exhortation unto us, that we ſhould do all in the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, let all your <hi>thoughts</hi> be in his name, all your <hi>words</hi> be in his name, all your <hi>actions</hi> be in his name; ſee you have warrant from his word for them, do all in his ſtrength and power, and lay by your own; do all as in his ſtead, think ſuch thoughts as Chriſt would think if he were preſent, ſpeak ſuch words as Chriſt would ſpeak, do all according to his will, do all for Chriſts ſake, do all for his honour and glory, do all invocating his name for advice in your actions.</p>
            <pb n="198" facs="tcp:94121:103"/>
            <p> 
               <hi>Q.</hi> But you will ſay, is it poſſible to do all in his name, can we alwayes have Chriſt in our thoughts, mouths, and actions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> To this I anſwer, that immediately we ſhould have a diſpoſition, a frame of ſpirit, an inclination of heart unto it, the very bent and tendency of our hearts ſhould be that way, <hi>the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of our ſouls is unto thee, and to thy name.</hi> So the deſire of our ſouls ſhould be unto Chriſt, and to his name, the bent and tendency of it ſhould be that way. And not only ſo, but,</p>
            <p>Secondly, I anſwer, 'tis well to have this, but 'tis not enough, we ſhould every morning at leaſt, actually mind and intend, the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and ſo go on all the day in that intention; as a bowl when it is thrown it runs by virtue of the ſtrength that is put into it from the arm that threw it at firſt, and runs till the ſtrength be ſpent; ſo we ſhould by virtue of a morning in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and in a morning conſideration of the name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, go on all the day long, and if we find it to flag (as it will quickly do) we ſhould renew our intentions and thoughts, in the name of Chriſt, ſend up ſecret Ejaculations to Heaven; O Lord, I deſire to think in thy name, and to ſpeak in thy name, and to act in thy name, this we may and ought to do, and not to reſt alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in an habitual inclination and diſpoſition; and they that do it ofteſt, they will order things beſt; beſt for themſelves, and beſt for Chriſts glory and advantage, but to preſs the exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Chriſtians ſhould do all in the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. I will give you three or four Motives.</p>
            <pb n="199" facs="tcp:94121:103"/>
            <p> Firſt, We ſhould do all in the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt upon this conſideration, it will aſſure us that the Lord Chriſt doth approve of us, and will be with us, and will make our actions ſucceſsful, and bleſs them unto us, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19, 20. Go ye therefore and teach all Nations, Baptizing them <hi>in the name</hi> of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt. Go, and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize them all in <hi>my name,</hi> and in their names: and what follows, teaching them to obſerve all things whatſoever I have commanded you; and lo, <hi>I am with you alwayes,</hi> even unto the end of the world. Do it in my name, I will be with you then, and I will bleſs you and proſper you, and I will make your Preaching ſucceſsful and uſeful: <hi>David</hi> went in the name of the Lord againſt <hi>Goliah,</hi> that grand enemy of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and did not the Lord bleſs him, and proſper him? did not he ſlay <hi>Goliah,</hi> and free the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> from their fears and dangers, the Lord was with him; <hi>David</hi> went out in the <hi>name</hi> of the Lord, in the ſtrength of the Lord will I go, and the Lord was with him whereſoever he went, and proſper'd him in all he went about; he did all things wiſely; would you therefore in ſpirituals, or in your ordinary callings and places, be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of by Chriſt, have Chriſt with you, and bleſs you, do all in his name, not in your own names, or in the name of others, but in his name, and in his name <hi>alone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, it is great wiſdom to do ſo, for what we do in Chriſts name, out of reſpect to him car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries much ſweetneſs in it. It is an impulſe of of love to ſuch a friend; we love Chriſt when we do it out of reſpect to his name; and 'tis our wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:94121:104"/>ſo to do; and the work of love is very ſweet. A wiſe man will do things ſo as they may be moſt ſweet and pleaſing to himſelf, and acceptable to him, he doth them: now when we do it upon this account. I ſay it is the impulſe of love, and there's a great deal of ſweetneſs in acting from love, there is as true ſweetneſs in acting <hi>for</hi> Chriſt, as when we <hi>receive from</hi> Chriſt; when you receive ſome influences of his ſpirit, when you have an anſwer of your Prayers, when you have your fears ſcattered, and are ſtrengthened with ſtrength in your ſouls, how ſweet is this? Now there is true ſweetneſs in acting for Chriſt; a true friend will do Chriſt ſervice, and be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for the ſervice, becauſe there is a great deal of ſweetneſs in it, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12. ſaith <hi>Paul, I thank Chriſt Jeſus our Lord, who hath enabled me,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting me into the Miniſtry.</hi> I thank the Lord Jeſus Chriſt that hath put me into ſervice; he would not have been thankful unleſs he had found ſome ſweetneſs in his ſervice.</p>
            <p>It will be our wiſdom therefore, to do all in the name of Chriſt, if you would find ſweetneſs in the name of Chriſt; ſo <hi>David</hi> and the Princes, when they had offered ſo willingly, as in the 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.13, 14. <hi>Now therefore, our God, we thank thee, and praiſe thy glorious name. But who am I, and what is my people, that we ſhould be able to offer ſo willingly after this ſort, for all things come of thee, and of thine own have we given thee.</hi> Lord, thou haſt given to us, and we have given to thee, and we thank thee that we have had hearts to give unto thee; how ſweet, delightful, and pleaſing is thy ſervice? therefore it will be your wiſdom to do all in the
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:94121:104"/>name of Chriſt; for it comes from love in you, and you will find ſweetneſs in doing for Chriſt, and you will be thankful for the ſervice you do upon that account.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, we ſhould do all in the name of Chriſt from this conſideration, that it is a ſpecial means both to prevent ſin, and to promote ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs.</p>
            <p>Firſt, to prevent ſin, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19. <hi>Let every one that names the name of the Lord Jeſus, depart from iniquity.</hi> He that names the name of Chriſt, muſt depart from iniquity; this is a preventing of ſin now, mentioning his name ſhould make us depart from iniquity. Why, the Lord Chriſt himſelf he hated iniquity, and loved righteouſneſs. His very name ſhould mind us thereof; Chriſt hates iniquity, and I will depart <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſom iniquity.</p>
            <p>Secondly, and acting in his name will put us upon holineſs, and labouring to he holy. The ſoul ſaith, will Jeſus Chriſt do this, I am a doing now; but would Chriſt do thus? would Chriſt think thus, would Chriſt ſpeak thus; no, Chriſt would not, Chriſt would ſpeak holy words, and do holy actions, and think holy thoughts, therefore I muſt do as Chriſt would do; I, do all in his name: we read of <hi>Alexander</hi> that had a Sould<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er in his Camp that did bear his name; when <hi>Alexander</hi> heard it, he calls for the Soldier, and asks him his name, he told him his name was <hi>Alexander;</hi> is it ſo, ſaith he, then ſee you do nothing unworthy the name of <hi>Alexander,</hi> do that which becomes <hi>Alexander;</hi> ſo, do we bear the name of Chriſt, we muſt do that which becomes the name of Chriſt; do we
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:94121:105"/>bear the name of Chriſtian? we muſt do what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a Chriſtian; one ſaid, I could do this or that, if I were not a Chriſtian; but I am a Chriſtian, and I dare not do this or that, I dare not go into ſuch Company, I dare not drink healths, I dare not be in the mode and faſhion of the world: And ſo in the Primitive times, the queſtion was, have you kept the Sabbath? the anſwer was, I am a Chriſtian, I dare not neglect the Lords day, I dare not ſpeak my own words, nor think my own thoughts, nor find my own pleaſure, and why, I am a Chriſtian, and ſo it promotes holineſs; therefore we ſhould do all in the name of the Lord Jeſus.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Laſtly, we ſhould do all in his name, becauſe it will unite and tye the heart of God and Chriſt abundantly to us. Thoſe perſons who act all in the name of Chriſt, they are faithful perſons; as a Servant that doth all in the name of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, he is a faithful Servant: The unjuſt Steward did not things faithfully, he did things in his own name, and therefore his Maſters favour was not towards him, he had none of his favour, nor countenance, his heart was alienated from him; but thoſe that do all in the name of the Lord Chriſt, they are faithful, and the heart of Chriſt is towards ſuch, and is wide unto ſuch; in <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.46. <hi>Bleſſed is that Servant whom his Lord when he cometh ſhall find ſo doing.</hi> Bleſſed is that Servant, why his heart is towards this Servant, and pronounces a bleſſing upon him; <hi>Bleſſed</hi> is that Servant whom his Lord when he cometh, ſhall find ſo doing; how doing? doing all in my name, and according to my will, and for my glory; doing all by invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:94121:105"/>of my name; O bleſſed is that Servant which when his Lord cometh ſhall find ſo doing; his heart is greatly towards him: The heart of his Maſter can truſt ſafely in him all the dayes of his life, as it's ſaid of the virtuous Wife, <hi>Prov.</hi> 31.11. <hi>The heart of her Husband doth ſafely truſt in her, ſo that he ſhall have no need of ſpoil:</hi> So the Lord Chriſt can truſt in that man or woman who doth all in his name; they are faithful, and he can truſt in them. I, it is a great honouring of Chriſt, and Chriſt will honour ſuch a one; it's an honouring of Chriſt, honouring of Chriſts wiſdom, honouring of Chriſts power, honouring of his word and name; it is the higheſt ſervice we can do to Chriſt, to do all in his name, and the Lord Chriſt will honour ſuch an one, his heart is tyed to him, he dares truſt him with all, he commits his ſecrets to ſuch. So then you ſee the exhortation back'd with ſome motives why we ſhould do all in the name of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>One thing more, which is, what directions will you give us now to help us to do all in the name of Chriſt? we ſee it is a duty, a good work, and we would gladly do it; but what directions and helps may be given to further us therein?</p>
            <p>Firſt, conſider, that the Lord Chriſt is your Lord. Whatſoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the <hi>Lord</hi> Jeſus, if you be Chriſtians, he is your <hi>Lord:</hi> Now our <hi>Lords</hi> commands, our <hi>Lords</hi> will, our <hi>Lords</hi> councels, we muſt do them, we muſt not do our own wills, we are the Lords, he is our Lord, and therefore we muſt do his will; <hi>Luke</hi> 6.46. <hi>Why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I ſay?</hi> What, do you call me
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:94121:106"/>Lord, and will not you do what I ſay, command, and appoint you, and do it <hi>as</hi> I appoint you, do all in my name? why do you call me <hi>Lord?</hi> Surely if Chriſt be our <hi>Lord,</hi> we muſt do all in his name; and the more we ſhall think of Chriſts Lordſhip and authority over us, the more will our hearts be inclined to do things in his name; why he is the beſt of Lords, he is a bleſſed Lord, a ſweet Lord, a good Lord; there is no Tyranny in this Lord, no hurt in this Lord, nothing but all for good in this Lord; he is Lord in your heart, he is Lord in your ſpirits, he is Lord in your tongues, he is Lord in your heads, he is Lord in all your wayes; therefore look upon him as Lord and Moderator of all your thoughts, words, and actions, and this will help you to do things in his name.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if you would do things in his name, then mind the very example, and practice of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, he did not do things in his own name, but he did all in his fathers name, and therefore we ſhould do all in his name, when he requires it of us, as the Father required it of him, he did all in his Fathers name, in <hi>Job.</hi> 5.43. <hi>I am come in my Fathers name,</hi> and ye receive me not; I am come, but I come in my Fathers name, I dont come in my own name, I run not on my own head, I come not with my own will, or my own words to do what I would, but I am come in my Fathers name, and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <hi>works</hi> he did, in <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.25. Jeſus anſwered them, I told you, and ye believe not, the works that <hi>I do in my Fathers name,</hi> they bear witneſs of me; all the works that I do, I do in my Fathers
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:94121:106"/>name, not in my own name: Now here's a good example for us to mind, the Lord Chriſt he did all in his Fathers name, and ſo ſhould we do all in Chriſts name; and if we do them in his name, we do them in the Fathers name alſo. <hi>Paul</hi> did all in Chriſts name, and we ſhould do all in Chriſts name. He did all in his Fathers name, and his example is an unerring example.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, If we would do all in the name of Chriſt, then let us get low<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>o the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. 'Tis want of love that makes us do ſo little in the name of Chriſt, if we had love e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to Chriſt, it would make us act in his name; the name of Chriſt is an Oyntment poured out, therefore do the Virgins love thee; if we did look at the name of Chriſt as an Oyntment poured out; ſweet, and precious, and ſaving, and comforting indeed: O it would make us love the Lord Jeſus, as the Virgins do: A Wife that loves her Husband, it will make her do all in her Husbands name; Oh, if we had love to Jeſus Chriſt, we would do all in his name; why the Lord Chriſt he loved his Father; and ſaith he, <hi>I keep his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, and abide in his love:</hi> 'Tis love will make you do things in the name of Chriſt, the more love is in any ſoul, the more it will act in the name of Chriſt, and honour him.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Laſtly, if we would do all in Chriſts name, then let us conſider the great reward that we ſhall have, the reward will be great if we do all in his name; I, there will
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:94121:107"/>be a reward here, and a reward hereafter; we glorifie him, and honour him much if we do all in his name. I, all the glory will be his; now if we glorifie him we ſhall have a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in our very acting; how ſweet is that action which is done aright? in a right manner, to a right end, from a right principle? how ſweet is it, as the Pſalmiſt ſaith, <hi>in keeping of thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements there is great reward;</hi> in the very keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the commands of God and Chriſt, is great reward, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

            <p>THe Pſalmiſt had lay'd down in the former part of the Pſalm, many commendations of the Law, the Statutes, the Commandements, the Teſtimonies and Judgments of the Lord. And here he draws up a concluſion concerning them all, <hi>They are more to be deſired then Gold, then much fine Gold.</hi> The words themſelves are a Doctrine, or an Obſervation, and you may take it thus,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> Divine truths are more to be deſired then the choiceſt Treaſures of the earth; then all earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly treaſures. Two things are here to be done.</p>
            <p>Firſt, to ſhew you that Gold is deſirable, and truths upon the ſame account.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that divine truths are more deſirable then Gold or Silver, or any earthly treaſures whatſoever.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, two things there.</p>
            <p>Firſt, what deſire is.—Secondly, that Gold is deſirable, and the truths of God upon the ſame account.</p>
            <p>Firſt, what deſire is, deſire is the reaching out of the ſoul after ſome good affected, not in poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but abſent: ſaith <hi>David,</hi> O that I had of the water of the Well of <hi>Bethlehem;</hi> here's the reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:94121:108"/>out of his ſoul after ſome good affected, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.15. ſaith <hi>Rachel, give me Children or elſe I dye:</hi> here's the reaching out of her Soul after Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
            <p>It is after good affected. Either ſeeming good, or real good affected. <hi>Love</hi> is the root that bears <hi>deſire,</hi> and <hi>deſire</hi> is the branch, or fruit; the hand and opperation of Love, what we have no Love to, we dont deſire, but what we have ſome Love too, that we do deſire.</p>
            <p>It is the affecting of Good, either ſeeming, or real; <hi>Solomon,</hi> he deſires wiſdom, that was a real good, and he had real deſires of it: The deſire of the Righteous is onely to good, ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> and there are ſeeming goods. <hi>Eve</hi> deſires the fruit, 'twas but a ſeeming good to her, for it brought woe and ſorrow to her and all hers. <hi>Amnon</hi> deſires <hi>Tamar,</hi> it was a ſeeming good, but a real evil. <hi>Achan</hi> deſires the Wedge of Gold, it was his ruine; <hi>Gehezi</hi> deſires the Garments, and the Wedge of Gold. Now there muſt be good, real, or in appearance, where deſire is carried out un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it; the ſoul ſees ſome amiableneſs in the thing it doth deſire, and ſo it puts forth its deſires after it, either ſome profit, or pleaſure, or ſome ſweetneſs, and therefore would enjoy it, and delight in it: So that <hi>deſire</hi> is the reaching out of the Soul after ſome good affected, not preſent but abſent.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond thing is, that as Gold is deſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſo upon the ſame account are the truths of God, the Laws, and Statutes, and Judgements of God. We ſhall ſee upon ſeveral accounts that Gold is commendable,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:94121:109"/>and deſirable; and upon the ſame the word of God is ſo too.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Gold is precious, there's a preciouſneſs in it, <hi>Ezr.</hi> 8.27. <hi>precious as Gold.</hi> The Heathens, yea and many others to, did ſo eſteem it, as they made Gods of Gold, they thought nothing more precious to make their Gods of than Gold: 1 <hi>King.</hi> 12.28. <hi>Jeroboam</hi> made two <hi>Golden Calves,</hi> and ſaid to Iſrael, theſe are thy Gods, and in the 115. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> Their <hi>Idols are Silver and Gold,</hi> ſpeaking of the Nations: So addicted were Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions unto this practice of making Gods of Gold, that God forbids his people to make Gods of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver or Gold. <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.23. yea, in the 17. <hi>Acts</hi> 29. you will find that they did liken the very God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head unto Gold. So then Gold is very precious, and as that is precious, ſo is the Word of God, that is precious as Gold, 'tis of great worth and value: The word is full of great and precious promiſes, and every promiſe is a Pearl of great price, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.13, 14, 15. <hi>Happy is the man that findeth wiſdom, and the man that getteth underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for the Merchandize of it is better than the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize of Silver; and the Gain thereof than fine Gold.</hi> It's more worth then all Rubies: The Word of God is very precious, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 138.2. <hi>Thou haſt mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified thy word above all thy name,</hi> what's the Name of God? The whole creation, all his works are his Name, they hold forth his power, his wiſdom, his goodneſs, his mercy, his loving kindneſs, bounty (and the like) now God doth magnifie his Word, or his Law above all his Name, he prizes it above the wrole creation, hence ſaith Chriſt, that not one jot or ſyllable of it ſhall fall to the
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:94121:109"/>ground: So that if Gold be precious, the Word of God is precious, and ſo deſirable upon that account.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Gold contains much in a little. A little piece of Gold contains many Shillings. And Gold is Ductile, a little piece of Gold may be drawn out to cover a great piece of ground. So the Word of God contains much in a little, <hi>Fear God,</hi> there's a great deal contain'd in theſe words. <hi>God manifeſted in fleſh,</hi> how much is contained in that word? And, <hi>Caſt all your care upon him,</hi> a great deal contained in that word: who can tell what treaſure is in any one Text of holy Scripture? There is more than any man, than all men can find or draw out. <hi>Chriſt is the Image of the inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble God,</hi> who can find out all that is in thoſe words? <hi>In him is all fullneſs,</hi> who can find out all the fullneſs of Chriſt? So that if Gold contains much in it, and is deſirable upon that account, the Word of God contains much in it, and is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable upon the ſame account.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Gold is very pure, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.18. The City was of <hi>pure Gold,</hi> and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 21.3. Thou ſetteſt a Crown of <hi>pure Gold</hi> on his head; Gold is very pure, 'tis purified and cleanſed from all droſs; ſo the Word of God: If Gold be deſirable becauſe of its purity, ſo it the Word of God being very pure: <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.5. Every Word of God is pure: Not onely <hi>one</hi> word, but <hi>every</hi> word of God is pure; and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 114.140. <hi>Thy word is very pure,</hi> there is nothing comparable to the Word of God for purity, and therefore deſirable as Gold is, upon that account.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="212" facs="tcp:94121:110"/> 4. Gold hath a beautiful ſplendor in it, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.21. 'Tis put for the Glory of the new Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,

The <hi>Glorious Goſpel:</hi> Full of Glory, and beauty, and ſplendor is the Word of God, and therefore deſirable as Gold is upon that account.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Gold is ſollid and weighty; the Hobrew word for fine Gold, is <gap reason="foreign">

            <p n="6">6. Gold it is of great uſe; it is of uſe,</p>
            <p>Firſt, to adorn and beautifie; what an Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was the Gold Chain about <hi>Joſeph's</hi> neck, <hi>Gen.</hi> 41.42. So <hi>Saul,</hi> he put on Ornaments of Gold upon the Apparel of the Daughters of Iſrael, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.24. Gold doth adorn and beautifie things; you beautifie many things, your Rooms, and Books, and many other things with Gold; So the Word of God is of an adorning and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying nature, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.9. <hi>She ſhall give to thine head an Ornament of Grace, a Crown of Glory ſhall ſhe deliver to thee.</hi> The word of God, the wiſdom of God, 'tis an ornament of Grace, a crown of Glory: nothing becomes a Chriſtian more than the Truths of God, they adorn the ſoul, and the very outward man, and makes the outward man lovely and beautiful when we hold forth the word of Life, and the word of God and of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Gold is of uſe to make Veſſels; for they made Veſſels for the Sanctuary, and for the Temple; there were Golden Tongs, Golden Candleſticks, and Golden Lamds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as you may find in the 1. <hi>King.</hi> 7. and 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.4. So the word, the word makes Golden Veſſels, it makes Golden Candleſticks, Golden Churches: All true Chriſtians and Believers are Golden Veſſels in the Temple of God, <hi>Lam.</hi> 4.2. <hi>The precious Sons of Zion, comparable to fine Gold.</hi> All true children of Zion are precious, and comparable unto fine Gold, to the fineſt
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:94121:111"/>Gold or Silver that is in the world. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. They <hi>make wiſe unto Salvation;</hi> they <hi>furniſh and fit a man for every good word and work;</hi> they make pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Veſſels.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Gold is ſaid to be <hi>a Cordial</hi> likewiſe: and is not the word of God a Cordial, the beſt Cordial we have in this world next to Chriſt, and God himſelf: The Word of God 'tis a ſweet Cordial, a ſweet Comfort unto the Soul.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Gold endures tryal, it will endure the fire, the exacteſt tryal that can be: <hi>Zech.</hi> 13.9. I will bring them through the fire, and try them as Gold is tryed: Gold is tryed, and tryed in the fire, and therefore it is eſteemed becauſe it will endure the fire: ſo the Word of God is a tryed word, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 12.6. The words of the Law are pure, as Silver tryed in a furnace of earth, purified ſeven times: The Word of God is a <hi>tryed word, Pſal.</hi> 18.30. <hi>The word of the Lord is tryed,</hi> his promiſes have been tryed in all Ages, they have had tryals ſeveral times, and ſeveral wayes: Thoſe that have received the word have been tryed, the Martyrs have been tryed, and they find the word to hold out in the ſharpeſt tryals, and to ſtand them in ſtead. So that you ſee Gold is deſirable, and upon what accounts, and upon the ſame account the Word of God is deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Now the ſecond thing is to ſhew you that Divine truths are more to be deſired than Gold, yea, than much fine Gold: More to be deſired, and that will appear ſeveral wayes.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Gold and Silver, and earthly treaſures, are at the will and command of men, and we may
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:94121:111"/>be deprived of them, <hi>Dan.</hi> 11.43. <hi>He ſhall have power over the treaſures of Gold, and of Silver, and ever all the precious things of Egypt.</hi> The King ſhould have power over them, and take them away from them, and we ſee how Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is ſubject to Thieſes, and to others, and we may be deprived thereof; But the Word of God when 'tis ours, when 'tis written in our hearts once, there's none can take it from us, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive us of it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Word of God, and Divine truths, are more deſirable than Gold, becauſe it's better than Gold. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.72. <hi>The Law of thy mouth is better unto me, than Thouſands of Gold and Silver.</hi> There's a <hi>betterneſs</hi> in the Word of God than in Gold and Silver; it exceeds it, and that in ſeveral reſpects.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Gold and Silver are ſubject to canker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſo to periſh, <hi>James</hi> 5.3. <hi>Your Gold and Silver is cankered,</hi> and the ruſt of them ſhall be a witneſs againſt you, and it is ſubject to <hi>corrupt,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18. ye are not redeemed with <hi>Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things, as Silver and Gold;</hi> and in the 1. <hi>Ch.</hi> 7. <hi>Gold that periſheth.</hi> But the word of the Lord pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth not, corrupts not, <hi>The word of the Lord en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures for ever,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.25. there's no corrupting, no cankering, no periſhing of the Word of God. Therefore it's better than Gold.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The word is better than Gold or Silver, becauſe it doth that which Gold and Silver cannot do, nor all the treaſures in the world can do; and what's that?</p>
            <p>Firſt, It is not in the power of Silver and Gold, and Riches or earthly Treaſures, to ſanctifie any
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:94121:112"/>mans heart or nature: They may pollute men, and they do pollute moſt, but ſanctifie none: But in <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.3. ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Now are ye clean, through the Word which I have ſpoken unto you.</hi> The word of Chriſt, and of God, is a cleanſing word; it will cleanſe your heads, your hearts, your lips, your lives: <hi>where withall ſhall a young man cleanſe his way, by taking heed thereto, according to thy word;</hi> But all the treaſures in the world will never cleanſe any, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.17. <hi>Sanctifie them through thy truth, thy word is truth.</hi> Gods word is a word of truth, and 'tis a word of Sanctification; that will make men and women holy; the more of the word is in you, the more holy you are, the more filthineſs of fleſh and ſpirit is purged out of you; So that it's better than Silver and Gold upon this account.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Silver and Gold can never ſatisfie you, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 4.8. <hi>The eye is not ſatisfied with Riches. Alexander</hi> had the world, and yet he was not ſatisfied, he would have another world. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5.10. <hi>He that loveth Silver, ſhall not be ſatisfied with Silver, nor he that loveth abundance, with increaſe.</hi> A man is never ſatisfied with theſe things that are below: The heart of man is triangular, and the whole world being round, can never ſatisfie a triangle; but the truths of God are ſatisfying truths: <hi>Open thy mouth wide, and I will ſill it,</hi> ſaith God; I will fill it with Divine truths, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.8. <hi>They ſhall be abundantly ſatisfied with the fatneſs of thy houſe,</hi> the word of God hath that in it will ſatisfie your ſouls; <hi>Eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, neither hath it entered into the heart of man to conceive, what God hath prepared for them that wait for him,</hi> and for them
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:94121:112"/>that love him: There is more prepared than you can expect or look for, and that will ſatisfie, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65.4. <hi>We ſhall be ſatisfied with the goodneſs of thy houſe:</hi> there is ſo much goodneſs in the houſe of God, there you have Communion with God himſelf, and with the Spirit, and with Jeſus Chriſt, and theſe will ſatisfie the ſoul, if ever it will be ſatisfied.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, They are more deſirable than Gold and Silver, becauſe it is deſire that makes the ſubject fit to receive the thing deſired. If a man be hungry, and thirſty, his hunger and thirſtineſs makes him fit to receive bread, and to take drink: Now the more excellent the thing to be received is, the more muſt it be deſired, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.37. <hi>He that loveth Father or Mother more than me, is not worthy of me; and he that loveth Son or Daughter more than me, is not worthy of me.</hi> Why I am the moſt excellent, therefore I muſt have the moſt love, and the moſt deſire: That Soul will never receive any real good by the Word, that doth not deſire it more than any other thing. If you deſire the Word but in competition to another thing, or equal to another thing, you will have no good by the Word; but you muſt deſire it more than other things, and therefore it is better than other things.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, If our deſires be more after the Word than after Gold and Silver, and theſe outward things, then theſe will fall in of courſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.33. <hi>Firſt ſeek the Kingdom of God and the Righteouſneſs thereof, and all theſe things ſhall be added unto you:</hi> we muſt firſt therefore ſeek the Kingdom of God; that is, we muſt more deſire the Kingdom of God
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:94121:113"/>than theſe things, if we labour to know the Goſpel, to know God and Jeſus Chriſt, and deſire the knowledge of theſe, other things will be given in, we need not trouble our ſelves about them, and ſpend our ſtrength and deſires after them, but after theſe, and then they will be caſt in.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Gold is of an earthly nature, and of an earthy abſtract; but the Word is from Heaven heavenly, 'tis a ſpiritual thing: There is nothing comparable unto the Word of God, all things thou canſt deſire are not to be compared to her, to the wiſdom of the Word. Now the Word be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heavenly, it is more to be deſired than Gold, which is but out of the bowels of the earth; The Word is ſpiritual, and comes from Heaven, and heavenly, and therefore more deſirable: So that you ſee upon what account it is that the Word is more to be deſired than Gold and Silver.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> Now a queſtion may be moved; with what deſires are we to deſire the Word of God?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt, We muſt deſire the Word of God with ſtrong and ardent deſires; with ſtrength of heart and ſoul; this ſhould be in our deſires, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.1, 2. <hi>As the Hart panteth after the water brooks, ſo panteth my ſoul after thee, O God: My ſoul thirſteth for God, for the living God, when ſhall I come and appear before God.</hi> He was baniſhed from the houſe of God, and from the Ordinances of God, and from the Word of God; now ſaith he, when ſhall I come and appear before God: I have ardent deſires, ſtrong deſires to be where God is, and his Word and Ordinances are; and in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.20. (a remarkable place) <hi>My ſoul breaketh for the longing that it hath unto thy Judgments
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:94121:113"/>at all times.</hi> My ſoul breaketh! what ardent, what ſtrong deſires were in the heart of <hi>David</hi> now after the Word of God? So then, they muſt be ſtrong and ardent deſires in our Souls after the Word of God, which is better than Gold or Silver.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Theſe deſires muſt be ſincere deſires: It may be men have deſires to the Word, but they are not ſincere; they ſhould deſire the Word for it ſelf, becauſe it is the Word of God, becauſe it is pure, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.440. <hi>Thy Word is very pure, therefore thy Servant loveth it.</hi> It is a good argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Truth, of Grace, and of a ſervant of God, to love the Word for the purity of it. Many can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not endure it becauſe it is pure; but if we love it, and deſire it for its purity, it's an argument we are right: Such ſhould our deſires be, ſincere deſires, to love the Word for it ſelf. It is ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere milk, and it calls for ſincere deſires, ſincere affections, there ſhould be no Bias in our affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, no crookedneſs, no ſelfiſhneſs, but ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere deſires unto the Word of God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Our deſires muſt be permanent, and abid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; not fleeting and flaſhy deſires, but perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, abiding deſires; our deſires ſhould be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to the Word of God, our hearts ſhould ſtand bent to the Word of God continually, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.20. My ſoul breaketh for the longing that it hath unto thy Judgments <hi>at all times.</hi> Mark, <hi>at all times;</hi> my ſoul is carried out with venement deſires unto thy Judgments at all times; I do continue, and maintain my deſires towards thy Word, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.2. <hi>In his Law doth he meditate day and night:</hi> when a mans deſires are to the Word
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:94121:114"/>of God night and day, here<hi>'s permanent, conſtant,</hi> and <hi>abiding</hi> deſires.</p>
            <p>But you will ſay, that's impoſſible for a man to hold up his deſires at ſuch a height, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue them.</p>
            <p>True, to fleſh and blood it is; but we muſt renew our deſires when they begin to flag and fall.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Laſtly, our deſires they muſt be opperative, and working deſires, many have lazy and ſluggiſh deſires, they have velleities, wiſhes, O that I did underſtand ſuch and ſuch things! O that I were acquainted with the Word of God (and the like;) they have velleities, and wiſhes, but they muſt be real deſires, which will put men upon ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scriptures, comparing place with place, reading, and meditating, and improving of truths: Mens deſires after Gold are ſuch, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.9. They <hi>that will be rich,</hi> how they will work, and labour, riſe early, and lye down late, and ſtudy, and caſt this way, and that way to get the world, to get Gold and Silver, ſuch ſhould be our deſires, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. Labour not for the meat that periſhes, but for the meat that endures to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life. So you ſee what kind of deſires the deſires of our ſouls ſhould be after the Word of God. I ſhall now come to ſome Inferences from the point. Are Divine truths more to be deſired than Silver and Gold? Then,</p>
            <p>Firſt, I infer, many are very faulty, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of blame, yea of great blame.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Thoſe that have no deſires to the Word of God: There are ſome people in the world that have no deſire to the Word of God, <hi>Job</hi> 21.14.
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:94121:114"/>
               <hi>We deſire not the knowledg of thy wayes:</hi> we have better wayes than thine, our own wayes; and as for thy wayes we dont deſire the knowledge of them, do theſe men look at the Word of God to be better than Gold or Silver? No, we dont deſire the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of thy wayes, it blames and condemns them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It blames thoſe who have moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire after Gold, and Riches, and after the things and pleaſures of the world: They have little de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire after Gods Teſtimonies, Statutes, Laws, and Judgments, little deſire after theſe, they cannot ſay the zeal of thy houſe hath eaten me up, but the zeal of the world hath eaten me up: Theſe are blameable that have ſo little deſires after the things of God, and ſuch ardent deſires after the world, and the things of the world.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It blames thoſe that have fleeting, tranſient deſires: now and then they have a fit, they have ſome deſires after the Word of God, but their deſires are fleeting, and tranſient, they dont keep up and maintain their deſires: Every morning, noon, and night we ſhould have deſires after the Word of God, and the wayes of God: <hi>David</hi> would prevent the morning watches, and ſeven times a day be would have his heart in a frame for God and the things of God, I at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night would he riſe to praiſe God for his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Judgments; but we have a fit now and then and away, and this is blameable.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, It condemns thoſe that have not ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and pure deſires: They have deſires after the Word of God for ſome baſe ends, they make a profeſſion that they may cover their wickedneſs with a pretence of Zeal, and Profeſſion, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:94121:115"/>and Godlineſs. As the Scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees, they made a ſhew, O they minded the Word, and every Letter and Syllable of the Word, and yet within (as Chriſt ſaith) they were full of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, Hypocriſie, and Uncleanneſs.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, It reproves thoſe that reſt in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and labour not to accompliſh their deſires, they dont put forth their deſires into endevours: and thoſe deſires are fooliſh and hurtful deſires, that dont carry out the ſoul to endeavours: All theſe come under cenſure, and are blameable.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If the truths of God are more deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable then Gold and Silver: Then here we may ſee who are the richeſt men in the world, and have the beſt treaſure, even thoſe that have gotten moſt of the Word into their hearts, not moſt of the world into their houſes and into their poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: the Word is better than thouſands of Gold and Silver: They are the richeſt that have moſt of this heavenly riches; let the word of Chriſt dwell richly in you, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. To be rich in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, there's the true riches, and great riches. Here we ſay, he is a rich man that hath many Bonds, or Ships, or Houſes, or Lands, that hath many Hundreds, or Thouſands lay'd up, or abroad: but he is the richeſt man in the Scripture account, and in Gods account, that hath moſt of the Word of God lay'd up in his heart, that hath moſt light in his underſtanding, moſt promiſes in his Soul, that hath a good ſtock, that hath a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure within; <hi>I have hid thy Law in my heart,</hi> ſaith <hi>David:</hi> So when Gods Law is hid in your hearts, then you are the richeſt men, the wealthieſt men, and men of ſubſtance indeed.</p>
            <pb n="223" facs="tcp:94121:115"/>
            <p> Thirdly, Then I infer from hence, that you may ſee a great difference between men and men; between Saints and the men of the world: The men of the world, they prize Gold and Silver, the Saints prize the Word of God: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.72. <hi>The Law of thy mouth, is better unto me than thouſands of Gold and Silver. David</hi> prized the Law of God more than his Kingdom, or the Crown of Gold that was upon his head more than the Gold of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>phaz,</hi> of <hi>Havilah,</hi> and the Gold of <hi>Ophyr,</hi> the fineſt Godl that might be had.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, If the Word of God be more deſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than Gold and Silver, then certainly their loſs is great that have the Word taken from them; I mean the Word outwardly, and the Ordinances and enjoyments, when our Silver and Gold is taken away, we cry out we are undone, we are undone: No, no, you are not undone if you have God and his Word; but if Gods Word be taken away from men and women, they are more undone than others: It's a great loſs to loſe that that is better than Gold &amp; Silver, better than all the world: There are many in the world at this day, that are depriv'd of their Teachers, of Sabbaths, and of the Word of God: They cannot read themſelves, and they have none to read unto them, it's a ſad condition, and a great loſs unto them, and thoſe that rob them of theſe they muſt anſwer for it one day, and they are very guilty that have done it.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, If the Word of God be more deſirable than Gold and Silver, then let us eſteem if ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the value and worth of it, above out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward treaſure, above all Gold and Silver: <hi>Jo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi>
               <pb n="224" facs="tcp:94121:116"/>eſteemed the Word of God more than his neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry food, people cannot eat Gold and Silver, and Houſe and Land, but their neceſſary food main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains their lives, and 'tis more valuable than Gold and Silver: If you could not have meat and drink, what would your Gold and Silver do you good? you would part with it all for a little bread, for a little drink; now <hi>Job</hi> did value the Word of God more than his <hi>neceſſary</hi> food: O that we would ſet ſuch a price upon the Word of God: <hi>I love thy Commandments above Gold, yea, above fine Gold:</hi> Let us all ſet ſuch a price upon the truths of God, there's more worth in them than you can find out: you have riches unſearchable in the promiſes, and in the truths of God, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Paul</hi> accounts all but dung for the excellency of the <hi>knowledge</hi> of Chriſt Jeſus: And where will you have that but in the Word of God, prize it therefore at a high rate, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.10. <hi>A day<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n thy Courts, is better than a thouſand elſewhere:</hi> A thouſand dayes are almoſt three years, and one would think they might meet with brave things in ſuch a time; but one day in the Courts of God is better than a thouſand elſewhere: The Word of God is little eſteemed in theſe dayes, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing preferred before it; but let it not be ſo with you.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, If the Word of God be more deſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than Gold, and fine Gold; then let us keep the Word of God as men keep their Gold, and lay it up as men lay up their Gold; and know, the Word of God if you will lay it up, it will be a defence unto you, and a Buckler unto you, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91.4. his truth ſhall be thy Shield and
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:94121:116"/>Buckler: <hi>Solomon</hi> tells you, <hi>money is a defence,</hi> and Gold is a defence; it will defend you from the injuries of the world and wrongs of men: ſo is the Word of God, it is a defence, it is a Shield, a Buckler, therefore lay it up ſafely as you would your Gold and Silver, <hi>Job.</hi> 22. <hi>The Almighty ſhall be thy defence:</hi> ſo you read it, but the Margent is, the Almighty ſhall be thy Gold: God would be your Gold if you would lay up Gods truth in your hearts, God will be your defence, he will be your Gold, your treaſure.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, Laſtly, if the Word and Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of God be more deſirable than Gold, yea than fine Gold, then let us deſire it more than outward treaſure, let us deſire it with ardent and ſtrong deſires, with ſincere deſires, with abiding conſtant deſires, with acting and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring deſires, let us uſe our utmoſt endeavour to be enriched with theſe riches, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.2. <hi>My ſoul longeth, yea even fainteth for the Courts of the Lord,</hi> my Soul longs ſaith <hi>David,</hi> and my ſoul faints for the Courts of the Lord; why, what was there? There was the Word of the Lord, there were the Ordinances of the King in his own Courts: and he long'd to be there where he might hear the word of God, and have the benefit of the Word of God. And in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.131. I opened my mouth and panted, for I longed for thy Commandments: Let us wait daily at the Courts of the Lord, lot us long, and take any pains we can for them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. <hi>Labour not for the meat that periſheth:</hi> all your Gold and Silver, and theſe things, are all of a periſhing nature, and will not continue long; but let us labour for the
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:94121:117"/>meat that endureth to everlaſting life: part with your Silver and Gold, which is from the earth; to get Scripture Gold, which is from Heaven. To get Divine truths into your heads and hearts. One queſtion more.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> You will ſay, how ſhall we get our hearts, and the deſires of them more inflamed after the Word of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt, Conſider your own poverty, and what riches there are to be had in the Word, when men conſider they are poor men, I am a poor man, I have neither houſe nor Land, I have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Gold nor Silver, and in ſuch a place is a Mine, and I may go thither and have riches enough, this will inflame his deſires. Now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider your ſpiritual poverty, conſider then I have little light, little grace, little ſtrength, it may be I have none at all; this will ſtrengthen your deſires after the Word of God, which will enrich you.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Let every one of us conſider what vile and baſe creatures we are, we are earth-born, and fleſh-born; but now the Word of God will enoble us, and make us Heaven-born, Spirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, 'twill elevate us. If a man be a poor beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly creature, and ſhall conſider, if I take ſuch a courſe I ſhall be a Noble-man, a Prince, a King, 'twill inflame his deſires to be in ſuch a ſtate and condition. Now it is the Word that will enoble us, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.12. <hi>To</hi> as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the <hi>Sons of God, even to them that believe on his Name.</hi> If you will believe on his name, on his Word, you will be enobled, and made the Sons and Daughters of
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:94121:117"/>God, <hi>which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of the will of man, but of God:</hi> And when are we ſaid to be born of God? but when we are born of the incorruptible ſeed of the Word of God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.23. <hi>Being born again, not of corruptible ſeed, but of incorruptible, by the Word of God which liveth and abideth for ever:</hi> If therefore you would conſider, what a baſe ſpirited crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture am I? but I would have a noble ſpirit, a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and heavenly ſpirit, and that's to be had by the Word of God, 'twill enflame your deſires towards the word, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.11. Theſe were <hi>more noble</hi> than thoſe in <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> they were better born than they, <hi>In that they received the Word with all readineſs of mind, and ſearched the Scriptures daily whether thoſe things were ſo:</hi> If you would therefore look into the Scriptures, and ſearch them, and mind them, you would be more noble Chriſtians than others, better born, of heavenly ſpirits.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Conſider what beauty is in the Word, what reallity, what excellency, what duration: If men and women would conſider what beauty there is in the Word of God, what excellency, if they did conſider this? it would inflame their deſires abundantly that way. See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.4.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Laſtly, conſider the ſutableneſs of the Word unto your conditions: There is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſutable in the Word to every man and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans condition in the world: and when we think of a thing ſutable to our conditions, 'twill ſtir up our deſires to it, when men and women are ſick, and they hear of a Medicine will cure them, their deſires are carried out ſtrongly to that Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine; now the Lord Chriſt hath Medicines for
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:94121:118"/>all Sores, and all Conditions; and the Word of God will be a Plaiſter for every Sore: if a man be ſick, there's ſomething to comfort him; if a man be dead, the word is a quickning word; if a man be in darkneſs, the word is an enlightning word. Therefore conſider of this and it will cauſe you to deſire the Word of God more than Gold and Silver, or any thing elſe in this world. It follows now in the latter part of the verſe.</p>
            <q>Sweeter alſo than Honey, and the Honey-comb.</q>
            <p>IN the firſt part of this verſe, you have the <hi>worth</hi> of the Word, and in this latter part you have the <hi>ſweetneſs</hi> of the Word. Gold is very precious, Honey is very ſweet; and by theſe two Metaphors it pleaſes the ſpirit of God to ſet out the worth and ſweetneſs of the Word. I muſt open this word, <hi>Honey.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Honey</hi> ſometimes in Scripture is taken literally, for a creature we call Honey: <hi>Judg.</hi> 14.8. there was a Swarm of Bees, and Honey in the Carcaſs of the Lyon that <hi>Sampſon</hi> had killed, and there 'tis in a literal ſence, <hi>Sampſon</hi> eats of it. So its ſaid, the taſte of Manna was like unto Honey, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. Wafers made with Honey.</p>
            <p>Sometimes in Scripture Honey is taken Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorically; and that,</p>
            <p>Firſt, For things ſweet and pleaſing to the taſte: things that are ſweet and pleaſing to the taſte, are called Honey, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.13. he made
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:94121:118"/>him to ſuck Honey out of the Rock; that is, the water that came out of the Rock was as ſweet as Honey unto them; it was not Honey, but ſweet as Honey. And <hi>Prov.</hi> 25.16. <hi>Haſt thou found Honey, eat ſo much as is ſufficient for thee;</hi> that is, haſt thou found any thing delightful, and ſweet, and pleaſing to thy taſte? eat that which is ſufficient for thee; any thing delightful to the taſte, is to be underſtood by <hi>Honey</hi> often in Scripture; ſo a full Stomach loaths the Honey-comb; that is, loaths ſweet and pleaſing things.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This Metaphorical ſenſe is put for gracious &amp; comfortable words, in <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. it's ſaid; Thy lips O my Spouſe, drop as the Honey-comb, Honey &amp; Milk are under thy Tongue; that is, thy Words, thy Conferences, thy Prayers are very ſweet and pleaſing. So in <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.24. <hi>Pleaſant words,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>are as the Honey-comb:</hi> That Honey which drops from the Honey-comb, is the ſweeteſt Honey, that is not preſs'd and ſqueezed out, but drops from the Honey-comb, as the Juyce which runs from the Grape without preſſing, makes the ſweeteſt Wine: Now there are many things which are ſaid to be ſweet in Scripture, ſweet Wines, ſweet Fruits, ſweet Sngar, ſweet Cane, ſweet Calamus, ſweet Spices, ſweet Incenſe; but none of all theſe are ſo ſweet as Honey: <hi>Judg.</hi> 14.18. what is ſweeter than Honey? they could not tell of any thing ſweeter than Honey, of all earthly things, that is the ſweeteſt: But <hi>David</hi> could tell them of ſomething ſweeter than Honey; thy Law, thy Teſtimonies, thy Statutes are ſweeter than Honey and the Honey-comb. Take Honey in a litteral ſence, or Honey in a
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:94121:119"/>metaphorical ſenſe, for any ſweet thing, the Word of God is ſweeter than all, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 114.103. <hi>How ſweet are thy Words unto my taſte; yea, ſweeter than Honey unto my mouth.</hi> And the Church ſaith of Chriſts mouth, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.16. that it is <hi>moſt ſweet:</hi> The gracious words of Chriſt are ſweet, are ſweeter than Honey; yea, they are moſt ſweet. So that all the degrees of Compariſon are in the Words of God and Chriſt, they are <hi>ſweet,</hi> they are <hi>ſweeter</hi> than Honey, they are <hi>moſt</hi> ſweet. The very words themſelves are a Doctrine or Obſervation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> Gods word is very ſweet; yea, the ſweeteſt thing of all. A little to inſtance in ſome things in the word of God.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Are not the Counſels of God ſweet? <hi>David</hi> ſaith, that the counſel he took with <hi>Ahitho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phel</hi> was ſweet, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55.14. what then was the counſel he took with <hi>God?</hi> how ſweet was that counſel? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.24. <hi>Thy Teſtimonies are my delight, and my Counſellers.</hi> Gods Teſtimonies were his Counſellers, and they were ſweet Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellers, and gave him ſuch ſweet counſel, as he delighted in them: he had ſuch counſel from the word of God as even raviſh'd his ſoul, ſuch ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs he found in it that he would be <hi>guided</hi> by Gods counſels all the dayes of his life; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.24. <hi>Thou ſhalt guide me with thy counſel, and afterward receive me to glory;</hi> ſo in <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.17. <hi>I counſel thee,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, unto the Church of <hi>Laodicea, To buy of me tryed Gold that thou mayeſt be rich, and white rayment, that thy nakedneſs may be covered, and the ſhame thereof may not be ſeen;</hi> was not this good and ſweet counſel that the Lord Chriſt did give to
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:94121:119"/>the Church, that was poor, and naked, and ſhameful, and deſtitute of all good. So that the counſels of God are ſweet counſels.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Are not the invitations that we find in the word very ſweet, ſweet invitations are there made unto poor ſinners, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.1. <hi>Ho every one that thirſteth, come ye unto the waters, and he that hath no money, come buy, and eat, come buy Wine and Milk without money, and without price.</hi> Here is a Hive of Honey, and Honey-combs in theſe words; come, come, come, here's <hi>water</hi> to quench your thirſt, here's <hi>wine</hi> to comfort your hearts, here's <hi>milk</hi> to nouriſh you, and cauſe you to thrive, and grow in the wayes of God, here's <hi>bread</hi> to ſtrengthen you, and here's <hi>all free,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out money. How ſweet are theſe invitations, come, come, come? and for ſuch things as are ſo excellent, and ſo precious; ſo that of the Lord Chriſt in <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.28. <hi>Come unto me all ye that are weary and heavy laden,</hi> and all of you come unto me, <hi>and I will give you reſt,</hi> how ſweet is this now to a burthened ſoul, to a burthened conſcience; for a man or woman that is in ſtraights, and knows not what to do, to come to the Lord Chriſt and they ſhall have reſt: in the 14. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 1. ſaith the Lord there, <hi>O Iſrael, return unto the Lord thy God; for thou haſt fallen by thine iniquity:</hi> one would have conceived, that Iſrael ſhould have <hi>firſt</hi> ſought to God; who had offended God, but God comes to delinquent Iſrael and ſaith, <hi>O Iſrael, return unto the Lord thy God, for thou haſt fallen by thine iniquities. Take with you words, and turn to the Lord, ſay unto him, take away all iniquity, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive us graciouſly, ſo will we render the Calves of our
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:94121:120"/>lips:</hi> he puts words into their mouths, how ſweet are theſe invitations of the Lord to poor ſinners. So in <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.34. <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world.</hi> There's ſweetneſs in the <hi>invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> that the word holds out unto us.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Are not the promiſes in the word of God very ſweet? ſweet, yea, ſweet as the Honey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb. There are many great and gracious promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. they are exceeding great &amp; precious promiſes: to have a promiſe from a great man that is able to perform his promiſe, and faithful, is ſweet unto a poor man; but to have exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great and precious promiſes from the great God who is able, and willing to perform, and faithful and will not fail; how ſweet are theſe promiſes to the Sons of men. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.25, 26. <hi>I will ſprinkle clean water upon you, and ye ſhall be clean, from all your filthineſs, and from all your Idols will I cleanſe you. A new heart alſo will I give unto you, and a new ſpirit will I put within you, and I will take away the stony heart out of your fleſh, and I will give you an heart of fleſh, and I will put my ſpirit within you, and cauſe you to walk in my Statutes, and ye ſhall keep my Judgments and do them.</hi> Are not here ſweet promiſes, very ſweet promiſes, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe upon promiſe: And all the promiſes of God they are very ſweet, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.40. <hi>I will make an everlaſting Covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them, to do them good, but I will put my fear in their hearts, that they ſhall not depart from me;</hi> what a ſweet promiſe is this to poor ſouls that fear they ſhall fall away, and ſhall not hold out to the end, God will put his fear into them,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:94121:120"/>and they ſhall not depart from him, <hi>I will heal their backſlidings and love them freely,</hi> Hoſ. 14. full of ſweet and precious promiſes is the word of God.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Is not the Goſpel, and the Doctrines of it very ſweet? Is not the Goſpel glad tidings? <hi>Luke</hi> 2.10, 11. <hi>Behold I bring you glad tidings of great joy, to you this day is born a Saviour.</hi> 'Tis a Goſpel of reconciliation, that declares the recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation of poor ſinners unto the great and holy God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. it is the Miniſtration of life, and of Righteouſneſs, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.8.9. it is the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Chriſt, 2 <hi>Joh.</hi> 9. what gracious words came out of the mouth of the Lord Jeſus; never man (ſaid his enemies) ſpake like this man; but there's ſweetneſs in this Doctrine, is it not ſweet that rich mercy is held out unto the chief of ſinners, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. <hi>This is a faithful ſaying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Jeſus Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſinners, of whom I am chief:</hi> what a ſweet ſaying is this, here is mercy held out to the chief of ſinners: ſo that, <hi>all manner of ſins and blaſphemies ſhall be forgiven,</hi> how ſweet is this, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.31. So that, God hath freely given his Son, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. <hi>God hath ſo loved the world, that he gave his onely begotten Son; That whoſoever believeth in him, ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life.</hi> Here is a ſweet truth unto thoſe that will underſtand truth, there is more ſweetneſs in it than they can taſte or find out, he is a propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in this is manifeſted the love of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, becauſe that God ſent his onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son into the world, that we might live through him; and to be the propitiation for our
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:94121:121"/>ſins, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.9, 10, 14, 15. By him we ſhall live, he is the Saviour of his body, the Saviour of ſinners. So, how ſweet is that, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. <hi>He is made of God unto us, Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification and Redemption.</hi> Here's ſweetneſs in theſe things, that we are freely juſtified by him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24. <hi>Acts</hi> 13.38, 39. How ſweet is that ſaying of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.37. (if there were no more in all the Goſpel but that) <hi>all that the Father giveth me, ſhall come to me, and him that cometh to me, I will in no wiſe caſt out.</hi> Let any poor creatures come unto me in their rags, in their filth, in their guilt, in their ſores, I will not caſt them out, I will not ſend them away diſcouraged, but they ſhall find favour in mine eyes. So the Doctrine of Chriſts interceſſion with the Father, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. <hi>If any man ſin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the Righteous:</hi> He is an Advocate to intercede for us, and to order all things for our good; ſo that there's a great deal of ſweetneſs in the word of God.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, There is ſweetneſs in the example of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, Chriſt waſhed his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples feet; what ſweetneſs is there in it, to think that the Lord of glory, and the Prince of life, and the Heir of the world, ſhould humble himſelf ſo as to waſh his Diſciples feet; and Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Learn of me, I am meek and lowly,</hi> &amp;c. Take my yoke upon you, and do you imitate me. The Lord Chriſt is the ſweeteſt example for us to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate that is in all the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, The parables of the Lord Chriſt, or the parables that are held out in the Word of God, are very ſweet parables. In the 15. <hi>Luke,</hi> what
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:94121:121"/>ſweet parables are in that Chapter; the loſt Sheep is found out; the loſt piece of Silver is found; the Prodigal Son comes home, and what ſweet entertainment hath he of his Father? The Father runs out to meet him, and doth not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid him, but runs and falls upon his neck and kiſſes him.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, The Providences that are held out in the Scripture, are ſweet providences: That of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> who was envyed of his Brethren, and ſold into <hi>Egypt,</hi> was it not a ſweet providence, to ſave the <hi>Egyptians</hi> lives, to ſave the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> lives. So the providences about <hi>Eſther, Vaſhty</hi> ſhe is remov'd, and Virgins are ſought out, and <hi>Mordecai</hi> diſcovers Treaſon, <hi>Haman</hi> gets up and ſeeks the ruine of all the Jews; <hi>Eſther</hi> is taken to be Queen, and brought in to ſave the Jews lives, and to take <hi>Haman</hi> out of the way.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, There is ſweetneſs in the experiences of the Saints of God, ſaith <hi>David,</hi> God hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered me out of the jaws of the Lion, and out of the paw of the Bear, and he will deliver me ſtill, and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116. Thou haſt delivered my ſoul from death, mine eyes from tears, and my feet from falling; and ſo <hi>Paul,</hi> God hath delivered, and he doth deliver, and he will deliver. The word is full of ſweet experiences of the Saints of God.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, the word of God is full of ſweet titles, titles that are given to God, and titles that are given to Chriſt, and titles given to the ſpirit, and titles given to the Saints.</p>
            <p>Titles that are given to God, as that God is a <hi>Father,</hi> a <hi>Father of mercies,</hi> a God of <hi>all conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> In the 68. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5. Theſe are helpleſs, and
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:94121:122"/>friendleſs, God is a Father to them. <hi>A Father of the Fatherleſs,</hi> how ſweet is this to fatherleſs ones, and helpleſs ones: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.14. <hi>Thou art the helper of the fatherleſs;</hi> ſo in <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14. <hi>In thee the fatherleſs findeth mercy;</hi> ſo, God is a <hi>fountain,</hi> and that of <hi>living waters, Jer.</hi> 2.13. A fountain that's alwayes flowing, and alwayes overflowing, overflowing with living waters, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 35.5, 6. <hi>The eyes of the blind ſhall be opened, and the ears of the deaf ſhall be unſtopped, then ſhall the lame man leap as an hart, and the tongue of the dumb ſing;</hi> why? <hi>for in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhall waters break out, and ſtreams in the deſert.</hi> God who is ſuch a fountain will make waters of life to overflow, and be in deſerts and wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes. So, God is the hope of <hi>Iſrael. Jer.</hi> 14.8. O thou, the <hi>hope of Iſrael,</hi> the Saviour thereof in the time of trouble. That God is the hope of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> it's a ſweet title, <hi>Thou art my hope in the day of evil,</hi> be not thou a terrour to me. Who is your hope in an evil day but God? and he is ſweet to thoſe that hope in him. So God is ſtiled a God ready to pardon, and forgive ſins, <hi>Neh.</hi> 9.17. he is not backward but ready, and forward to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give ſins, to pardon iniquities, ſins, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions. <hi>Let the wicked forſake his way, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous man his thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him, and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon, Iſa.</hi> 55.7. So, he is the God of grace, and glory: There is no grace but in him, no glory to be had but by him.</p>
            <p>So for the titles of the Lord Chriſt: There are ſweet titles in Scripture given to him: that he is the Shepherd, and the true and faithful Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:94121:122"/>1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.25. and in the 10. <hi>Joh.</hi> he is the faithful Shepherd, the great Shepherd of the ſheep, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.10. The good Shepherd that will ſee you ſhall want nothing, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23.1, 2, 3. The Lord is my Shepherd, I ſhall not want. He maketh me to lye down in green paſtures, he leadeth me beſides the ſtill waters, he reſtoreth my ſoul, he leadeth me in the paths of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. What a Shepherd is Chriſt, in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.11. A Shepherd that gathers his Lambs with his arms, carries them in his boſom, and gently leads thoſe that are with young; he is a faithful Shepherd to all his Sheep and Lambs, So, Chriſt is a Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian to heal all your wounds; yea, the good Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan mentioned in <hi>Luke,</hi> when the Prieſt and the Levite paſt by the man that was wounded; the Lord Chriſt was a good Samaritan, and drops oyl into his wounds, and gives him wine to drink, ſets him upon his beaſt, and carries him to an Inne, and hath him look'd after: what a ſweet title is this of the Lord Jeſus? He is called like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, <hi>The childrens bread. Matth.</hi> 15.26. It is not meet to take the <hi>childrens bread,</hi> and to caſt it to dogs; he ſpeaks of himſelf, what good bread is that bread? My fleſh, ſaith Chriſt, is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.53, 55. The Lord Chriſt is ſtiled <hi>the Deſire of all Nations.</hi> What a ſweet title is that, <hi>Hag.</hi> 2.7. <hi>The Deſire of all Nations ſhall come,</hi> a bleſſing to all Families, <hi>In thee ſhall all the Families of the earth be bleſſed,</hi> he was therefore the deſire of all Nations; ſo he is called a <hi>Friend,</hi> Joh. 15.15. a <hi>Bridegroom,</hi> Joh. 3.29. a <hi>Husband,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2. a <hi>Mediator,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.5. an <hi>Advocate,</hi> 1 Joh. 2. a <hi>Brother,</hi> Heb. 2.12. a
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:94121:123"/>
               <hi>Father,</hi> an <hi>everlaſting Father,</hi> Iſa. 9.6. and there is one more which hath all theſe in them; he is called, <hi>The Conſolation of Iſrael,</hi> Luk. 2.25. If Iſrael have any true conſolation, it muſt be from the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; if the ſoul ever have any true comfort, it muſt be from him. He finiſhes the tranſgreſſion, makes an end of ſins, makes reconciliation for iniquity, brings in everlaſting righteouſneſs, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.24.</p>
            <p>So the titles that are given to the Bleſſed Spirit of God; are all ſweet titles: The Spirit is called a <hi>Remembrancer, Joh.</hi> 14.26. 'Tis a ſweet thing to have one to put you in mind of every thing. So the bleſſed Spirit is the <hi>Recorder</hi> in the Church, to put the Church in mind of her duty, to mind her of the counſels of God, and invitations, and promiſes, and doctrines (and the like) The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits title is an <hi>Helper:</hi> we know not what to pray for, but the Spirit helpeth our infirmities, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26. the Spirit is a <hi>Teacher,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.27. the Spirit is a <hi>Sanctifier,</hi> Rom. 1.4. according to the Spirit of holineſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.16. ſhe Gentiles were ſanctified by the Holy-Ghoſt. 'Tis a revealer of deep and hidden things, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.17. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9, 10, 11, 12. Laſtly, the Spirit is a <hi>Comforter, Joh.</hi> 14.26. he ſhall ſend you the Comforter, and it's the beſt Comforter that we can have.</p>
            <p>So likewiſe the titles that are given to the Church of God, and to believing ſouls; the Church is called the Temple of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.16. So is every believer; the Church is ſaid to be the Lords portion, and his treaſure, <hi>Jer.</hi> 12.10. So is every believing ſoul Gods portion, and his pleaſant portion. Again, it's called the ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomed
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:94121:123"/>ones, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 35.10. the ranſomed of the Lord. God hath been at great coſt and charges to ranſome the Church, purchaſed it with his own blood, <hi>Acts.</hi> 20.28. It's called Chriſts body, and how ſweet is it to the thoughts of Saints to think, I am a member of Chriſts own body, I am a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the precious body of the Lord Jeſus. It's called, <hi>Gods beloved,</hi> Pſal. 108.6. <hi>The dearly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved of his Soul,</hi> Jer. 12.10. The Church is <hi>the Bride, the Lambs wife.</hi> Rev. 21.9. The Church is the bleſſed of God, and ſo is every believing ſoul, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.9. It's the ſeed which the Lord hath bleſſed: The other ſeed is a curſed ſeed; but this ſeed is a ſeed which the Lord hath bleſſed; yea, bleſſed with all ſpiritual bleſſings in Chriſt. Laſtly, it's the glory of God; the Church is the glory of God, and every believing ſoul, is the very glory of God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 4.5. Upon all the glory ſhall be a defence; All true believers they are accounted the glory of God. Thus you ſee there is ſweetneſs in the word.</p>
            <p>But wherein is the word ſweeter than Honey, and ſweeter than the Honey-comb? In ſeveral particulars.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the ſweetneſs of Honey is Natural, that of the Word is Divine and Spiritual; and look how much ſpiritual doth exceed natural, ſo much the ſweetneſs of the word doth exceed the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of honey. All ſpiritual things do exceed na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural things, and the word is from Heaven, a divine word, a heavenly word, and honey is but from the earth. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.14. The Law is ſpiritual, and the Goſpel is ſpiritual, it is the Miniſtration of the Spirit: and <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4. <hi>and have taſted of the
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:94121:124"/>heavenly gift.</hi> The <hi>word</hi> is a heavenly gift, and it hath heavenly ſweetneſs in it. It is ſweeter in the taſte than any earthly gift whatſoever.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The ſweetneſs of the word refreſheth the <hi>heart</hi> of a man, ſo doth not honey, honey dont affect the ſoul; it doth affect the pallate, and the taſte, but it dont refreſh the heart and the ſoul; but the word doth affect the ſoul, and the heart of a man or woman. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.111. Thy Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies are the rejoycing of my heart: the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, Statutes, and truths of God, they do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce the very heart and ſoul of a man or of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and <hi>v.</hi> 77. <hi>Thy Law is my delight;</hi> and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.8. <hi>The Statutes of the Lord rejoyce the heart:</hi> when the heart is heavy and ſad, the word of God will rejoyce it, and revive it, which all the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in the world can never do.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Honey, and Honey-combs, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſweeten bitter afflictions: they may ſweeten bitter waters, or bitter things, but they cannot ſweeten bitter afflictions. But the word of God doth ſweeten bitter afflictions, and can do that which honey cannot do: If a man eat never ſo much honey, it will not ſweeten his affliction, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.49. <hi>Remember the word unto thy Servant, upon which thou haſt cauſed me to hope. This is my Comfort in my affliction, for thy word hath quickned me.</hi> The word of God will comfort you in any affliction whatſoever, it will ſweeten the bittereſt waters that can be; and ſo in the 92. <hi>v. Unleſs thy Law had been my delights, I ſhould then have periſhed in mine affliction.</hi> Men and Women would periſh in their afflictions, if they had not ſome word of God to uphold them, and to comfort them; and
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:94121:124"/>in the 54. v. <hi>Thy Statutes have been my Songs, in the houſe of my pilgrimage.</hi> So that they are ſweeter than honey, and can ſweeten any affliction that we meat withall. As the bough that was caſt into the bitter waters it ſweetned them; ſo doth this bough (the word of God) ſweeten the moſt bitter waters that are.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The Word doth ſanctifie all things, and makes them ſweeter than they were; yea, the word doth ſweeten honey it ſelf, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.5. <hi>Every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if it be received with thanksgiving; for it is ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified by the Word of God and Prayer. Sanctified</hi> by the word of God, let your mercies be covenant mercies, and choice mercies, they are ſanctified more now by the Word of God: They are ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Word of God and Prayer: your very ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, which is ſo ſweet, is made ſweeter when it is ſanctified honey by the Word of God and Prayer. So that the word of God is ſweeter than honey, it ſweetens all things unto us.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Men may eat too much of honey, <hi>Prov.</hi> 25.27. <hi>'Tis not good to eat much Honey,</hi> and in the 16. <hi>v.</hi> you have the reaſon of it; <hi>Haſt thou found honey, eat ſo much as is ſufficient for thee, leſt thou be filled therewith, and vomit it.</hi> If you eat too much honey, you may vomit it: But now for the word of God, we can never eat too much of that honey: <hi>John</hi> did eat up the little book, <hi>Rev.</hi> 10. he eat up the whole book: So if we ſhould eat up the whole book of God, 'twould never be too much, it will never make us vomit, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Let the word of Chriſt dwell in you richly;</hi> and in the 119. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27. <hi>O how I love thy Law, it is my Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation all the day;</hi> you can never meditate too much
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:94121:125"/>in the Law of God, nor feed too much upon the promiſes, invitations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sixthly, Laſtly, The word is the ſavour of life unto life; ſo is not honey, honey cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce life, it cannot work in any man a ſpiritual life; but the word is the ſavour of life unto life; it begets life in the ſoul, 'tis called the word of life; and <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.16. 'tis the ſavour of life, of ſpiritual life; yea, of eternal life: The words that I ſpeak, they are ſpirit, and they are life. And ſaith <hi>Peter, Thou haſt the words of eternal life;</hi> how ſweet is life, and how ſweet is eternal life, and the word of God hath this ſweetneſs in it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> Now having ſhown you that the word is ſweeter than honey, and wherein, a queſtion may ariſe here, if the word be ſo ſweet, what is the cauſe that perſons taſte not the ſweetneſs of it. There be many read the word, and hear the word; but dont taſte the ſweetneſs of the word. There be ſeveral reaſons for it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An.</hi> Firſt, Becauſe ſome have no ſpiritual taſte, no ſpiritual ſenſe. We read of <hi>Barzillai,</hi> that ſaid to <hi>David</hi> (when he would have had him gone with him to the Court, ſaith he, thy Servant cannot taſte what I eat, or what I drink, ſo many there be that have no ſpiritual taſte at all in them: And where there is no taſte, all things are alike, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.3. his fruit was ſweet unto <hi>my</hi> taſte, the Church had a taſte, and found ſweetneſs in the fruit of Chriſt; where there is a ſpiritual life, there is a ſpiritual taſte, where there is no ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual life, there is no ſpiritual taſte at all. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. They had their ſenſes exerciſed to diſcern be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween good and evil; ſome have no ſpiritual ſenſes,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:94121:125"/>they cannot diſcern between good and evil, therefore they find no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>etneſs in the word of God, that's one reaſon; men and women are dead in ſins and treſpaſſes, and never are quickned with the life of grace.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Some have their taſtes, yet find no ſweetneſs, becauſe they have a fullneſs of other things in them, <hi>Prov.</hi> 27.7. <hi>The full ſoul loatheth an Honey-comb.</hi> If there be a fulneſs in us, nothing is ſweet unto us; now men and women are full of ſeveral things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, ſome are full of the world, <hi>Amos</hi> 8.5. when will the new moon be gone, that we may ſell Corn, and the Sabbath, that we may ſet forth wheat (and the like) theſe were full of the world and ſo they could not taſte of ſpiritual things. <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.12. <hi>He that received</hi> among Thorns, is he that heareth the word, and the care of this world, and the deceitfulneſs of riches, choke the world, and he becometh unfruitful.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Some are full of conceitedneſs, in <hi>Luke</hi> 18.11. The Phariſee, he was conceited of his own goodneſs, righteouſneſs, and doings: and the Church of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> ſhe was full and wanted nothing, and ſo could not taſte the dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Lord, nor the ſweetneſs that was in his Ordinances, and his word, there was ſuch a fullneſs in them of their own conceitedneſs, that they wanted nothing.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, There is a fullneſs of errors in many, a fullneſs of opinions. Scribes and Phariſes, they found no ſweetneſs in Chriſt, nor in Chriſts way, they were full of their own opinions, errors, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions and falſe doctrines: So, many now are
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:94121:126"/>full of their own light, and the light within, that's all in all unto them, and they find no ſweetneſs in Ordinances, nor in the means of Grace.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Many, yea moſt are full of creature delights, and creature contentments, and creature comforts, full of ſenſual pleaſures, they take ſo much pleaſure in the creature, in their outward comforts, contentments, in their eſtates, and rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in their gifts, and parts, and things of that nature, that they can taſte no ſweetneſs in the word of God.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Men taſte not the ſweetneſs in the word, becauſe of their ſlighting of the word; and hence it is a juſt Judgment of God to ſuffer them not to taſte the ſweetneſs that is in the word, when they made light of the Goſpel, and the Goſpel dainties prepared for them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.5. They went away and flighted the invitation to the Goſpel feaſt. It is ſaid in <hi>Luke</hi> 14.24. none of them ſhall <hi>Taſte</hi> thereof; that is, none of them ſhall ever taſte the ſweetneſs, or goodneſs therein; they might hear, but they ſhould taſte no ſweetneſs in their hearing; and therefore to ſlight the word of God is a great evil, and will h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nder perſons from taſting the ſweetneſs that is in the word of God.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, A fourth reaſon is that formality that is in the people, they come to the Word and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of God with formal hearts and ſpirits, we come not to the Ordinances as the Ordinances of God, we come not to the word as the word of the great God, we hear not for time to come, we hear not for eternity, we hear not as matters of life and death, and therefore we dont find that
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:94121:126"/>ſweetneſs as they do that hear ſo. Men pray, but not in the Spirit; ſerve God, but not in Spirit; they draw near God with their lips, but their hearts are far from him.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, And I may add one thing more, peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple dont find ſweetneſs in the word of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they do nouriſh ſome baſe luſt or corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in their hearts: And <hi>Peter</hi> gives you an inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of this, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1. <hi>Wherefore laying aſide all malice, and all guile, and hypocriſie, and envies, and evil-ſpeakings, as new-born babes deſire the ſincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby.</hi> If there be in our hearts ſuch things, we ſhall not taſte the ſweetneſs of the ſincere milk of the word, neither ſhall we grow thereby, ſo now you ſee what hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the taſting of the ſweetneſs of the word.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> Another queſtion may ariſe hereupon, and that is, What ſhould we do to find ſweetneſs in the word of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An.</hi> Firſt, If you would find ſweetneſs in the word of God, get <hi>hungry ſouls,</hi> Prov. 27.7. <hi>To the hungry ſoul, every bitter thing is ſweet:</hi> If we had hungry ſouls, the bittereſt truth in all the word of God would be ſweet unto us. Now there be three things which beget hunger in men and women; there's Faſting, Purging, and Excer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, If you would have hungry ſouls, you muſt faſt much; I dont mean a faſting from bread, meat and drink; but from ſin, faſting from pleaſures, and delights, faſting from lawful things of the world, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.29. <hi>The time is ſhort. It remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that both they that have Wives, be as though they had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>one; and they that weep, as though they wept not;
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:94121:127"/>and they that rejoyce as though they rejoyced not; and they that bay, as though they poſſeſſed not.</hi> Faſt from your lawful enjoyments, from your pleaſures, delights, and contentments, and this will breed an appetite to the word of God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Purging, we take bitter things to purge us; ſo we ſhould take ſomething to purge our Hearts, our Heads, and Conſciences: Be ſenſible of ſin, and the bitterneſs of ſin; what a bitter and evil thing ſin is, what danger ſin doth involve the ſoul in, and expoſe it to; the wrath of God, hell, and damnation: we ſhould take ſome pills to mortifie our luſts, and then the word of God would be ſweet unto us indeed.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Exerciſe will beget a ſtomach, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.7. <hi>Exerciſe thy ſelf to Godlineſs.</hi> If men and women did pray much, read much, meditate much, and have their hearts much in Heaven, they would have hungry ſouls after the word of God, and find a ſweetneſs in the word of God: <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.17. ſaith he there, <hi>If any man will do his will, he ſhall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I ſpeak of my ſelf.</hi> He ſhall know whether the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine be not an heavenly Doctrine, and a ſweet Doctrine, he ſhall taſte the ſweetneſs of my Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine that I have brought down from my Father, if he will <hi>do</hi> the will of God; So that thats the firſt thing, to get hungry Souls, and then we ſhall re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ith the word of God, and find ſweetneſs in it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If we would find ſweetneſs in the word of God, we ſhould make much Conſcience of the Lords time and day, and ſanctifie the Lords day, if we did ſanctifie the Lords day as we ought
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:94121:127"/>to do, we ſhould find ſweetneſs in his Ordinances, and ſweetneſs all the week after in his Ordinanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and in his word. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.13.14. <hi>If thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath, from doing thy pleaſure on my Holy day, and call the Sabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord, honourable, and ſhalt honour him, not doing thine own wayes, nor finding thine own plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, nor ſpeaking thine own words. Then ſhalt thou delight thy ſelf</hi> in the Lord, thou wilt find ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the Lord, and ſweetneſs in the words and wayes of the Lord, in all things of the Lords thou wilt find ſweetneſs; ſuch ſweetneſs as will make thy ſoul to delight in the Lord.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, If you would find ſweetneſs in the word of God, then take that which is ſuitable to your conditions; There is ſomthing alwayes ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to your conditions: when you read the word, or hear the word Preach'd, ſomething will concern you; now that which is moſt ſuitable to your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, will be moſt ſweet unto you: If one want peace, and there be a word ſuits you, take that; if one want comfort, take that; if one want coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, take that; that that is ſuitable to the ſoul, that's ſweet.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Laſtly, make the word your delight, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.24. <hi>Thy Teſtimonies are my delight.</hi> So in the 77. <hi>v. Thy Law is my delight.</hi> They were the delight of <hi>David;</hi> and ſo he delighted in them, that he meditated in them day and night: <hi>Thy Teſtimonies are my Meditation,</hi> v. 99. what you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in, you find a ſweetneſs in; ſo if you would delight much in the word of God, you would find much ſweetneſs in the word of God: Thus you ſee thoſe queſtions anſwered.</p>
            <pb n="248" facs="tcp:94121:128"/>
            <p> I ſhall now come to ſome Inferences, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions.</p>
            <p>Firſt, If the word of God be ſweet, and ſweeter than the Honey and the Honey-comb, then they that find no ſweetneſs in the word of God, they are in an ill condition, they are in a ſtate of death, they are dead men, and dead wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. A dead man taſtes nothing, ſo that man or woman that taſtes no ſweetneſs in the word of God, is a dead man: you read in Scripture, of men <hi>dead in ſins and treſpaſſes,</hi> and <hi>twice dead; Let the dead bury their dead,</hi> ſaith Chriſt; how can the dead bury their dead? let them who are dead in ſins, bury thoſe that are dead in body; if you find no ſweetneſs in the word of God, you are dead men, dead women.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If the word be ſo ſweet, then it's no wonder if ſome perſons are ſo taken with the word of God, they are always reading the word of God, and looking into the word of God, and meditating in it, and why its ſweet and delightful to their ſouls. Thoſe that have Gardens full of ſweet flowers, they love to be often looking into their Gardens; ſo thoſe that are Godly, how do they find ſweetneſs in the word of God? In every promiſe, in every truth, in all the providences and experiences of the Saints, they find a great deal of ſweetneſs therein.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, If the word of God be ſo ſweet, then praiſe and bleſs the Lord for the ſweetneſs of his word, that he hath given you out ſuch a word; praiſe him for his ſweet invitations, for his ſweet promiſes, for the ſweet and heavenly doctrines, for the ſweet titles you meet with therein. In
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:94121:128"/>the 56. <hi>Pſal.</hi> you have it three times, <hi>I will praiſe his word;</hi> praiſe the word, and praiſe God who hath given you ſuch a word; ſuch a word that is ſo ſweet, that is ſo precious, have you not found the ſweetneſs of it in your affliction, in your temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, in your darkneſs, in your deſertions; O praiſe the Lord for his ſweet word, and let God have the glory of it.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, If the word of God be ſweet, and ſweeter than Honey, and the Honey-comb, then ſurely they do ill that caſt off the word of God, and caſt off his Ordinances, and leave off the things that are good. Many in theſe dayes they caſt off Ordinances, and lay aſide the word of God, and are altogether for the light within, and nothing but for the light within; but it is to be ſeared that their light is but darkneſs, for the light of the Scripture will never direct men to caſt off it ſelf; The word of God is to be a light unto our feet, and a lamp unto our paths; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they do ill who caſt off the word of God that is ſweeter than Honey, and the Honey-comb, and that lay aſide the Commands of God, and the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of God.</p>
            <p>But they will ſay, we lay aſide the Honey-comb, and we take the Honey.</p>
            <p>For anſwer to that, look into the 5. <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. I am come into my garden, <hi>&amp;c. I have eaten my Honey-comb with my Honey.</hi> The Church would eat the Honey-comb with the Honey, ſhe would have the Ordinances, and the ſweetneſs through the Ordinances, by the Ordinances: The Ordinances are the Honey-comb, and the ſweetneſs that God conveys through them is the Honey.</p>
            <pb n="250" facs="tcp:94121:129"/>
            <p> Fifthly, If the word be ſweeter than Honey, and the Honey-comb, then in all your afflictions, and bitter waters you have to drink, ſweeten them with this Honey, and this Honey-comb, ſweeten them with the word of God: Afflictions are very ſowr, ſad and heavy many times; but the word of God is Honey to ſweeten them, when they came to the waters of <hi>Marah,</hi> and could not drink them they were murmuring, and troubled, and they ſhould periſh for want of water, but <hi>Moſes</hi> takes a bough and throws in and ſweetens the waters, ſo that they could drink them, and were revived and refreſhed. So if men and women would but ſweeten their afflictions with the word of God, they would go down very ſweetly: The ſteps of a good man (ſaith the Pſalmiſt) are ordered by the Lord, and he delighteth in his way, though he fall, he ſhall not utterly be caſt down: what though you fall into afflictions, you ſhall not ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly be caſt down, for the Lord upholdeth him with his hand: and <hi>James</hi> 1.12. <hi>Bleſſed is the man that endureth Temptations;</hi> that is afflictions: <hi>for when he is tryed, he ſhall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promiſed to them that love him.</hi> who would now be troubled at temptations and afflictions, when a <hi>bleſſedneſs</hi> is fixed to them. <hi>Bleſſed is the man that endureth Temptations,</hi> &amp;c. You ſhall have a crown of life for your tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, what if they take away life? you ſhall have another life, and a crown of life; ſo that we ſhould ſweeten our afflictions with the conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the word, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17. <hi>The outward man decayes, but the inward man is renewed daily;</hi> and ſaith he, <hi>our light affliction, which is but for a moment,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:94121:129"/>worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory.</hi> Here's <hi>light affliction,</hi> here's <hi>weighty glory,</hi> here's <hi>glory</hi> oppoſed to <hi>affliction,</hi> here's <hi>weight</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to <hi>light,</hi> here's <hi>eternal</hi> oppoſed to <hi>momentary,</hi> and here's <hi>exceeding</hi> above all that. How ſweet would this be in our afflictions if we did lay it to heart, and receive in theſe truths to ſweeten our afflictions.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, If the word of God be ſweeter than Honey, and the Honey-comb: Then eſteem the word of God very highly, dont think meanly of the word of God, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Paul</hi> did eſteem the knowledge of Chriſt above all knowledge in the world, the excellency of the knowledge of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; that is, the knowledge of the Goſpel, and the knowledge of the word: There's an excellency in it beyond all knowledge, all Hiſtories, and all Arts and Sciences whatſoever; there is not that excellency in them as in the word of God, therefore eſteem it highly, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.10. <hi>A day in thy courts, is better than a thouſand:</hi> In the courts of God. There was the word of God preached and held forth, and read, and interpreted, and therefore a day there is worth a thouſand dayes elſewhere.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, If the word of God be ſo ſweet, ſweeter than the Honey and the Honey-comb, then feed much upon the word of God; in the 24. <hi>Prov.</hi> 13. ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi> to his Son, <hi>My Son, eat thou Honey becauſe it is good.</hi> So let me ſay to you, Eat this Honey becauſe it is good; Honey hath three great properties. Honey doth cleanſe, it doth preſerve, and honey doth pleaſe. Eat this ſpiritual Honey, 'twill pleaſe your ſpiritual ſouls
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:94121:130"/>and appetites, it will preſerve you from all evil, it will cleanſe you from all your pollutions. <hi>David</hi> loved to be in the courts of God, and to be feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon this Honey continually, and to be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65.4. <hi>We ſhall be ſatisfied with the goodneſs of thy houſe;</hi> it will ſatisfie me in point of cleanſing, in point of preſerving, in point of pleaſing; I am never better pleaſed, nor ſafer, nor in a purer condition, then when I am under thy word; ſeed much upon this: others feed upon Acorns, and upon the Wind, and Aſhes (and the like) but Saints feed upon Honey; the Honey of Gods word, the Honey that will do your ſouls good to eat, it will ſweeten all of your afflictions.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, Laſtly, if the word be ſweeter than Honey and the Honey-comb, then try whether it be ſo to you or no: Try whether you have found the word to be ſweet to you; ſweet as Honey, and as the Honey comb. Honey will ſweeten other things, ſo if the word have been Honey to you, it will ſweeten you; it ſweetens men and women, it ſweetens their ſpirits; men have harſh, ſowr, and bitter ſpirits of themſelves; but if the word have been Honey to them, it hath ſweetned their ſpirits, and calm'd and meekned their ſpirits, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.31, 32. <hi>Let all bitterneſs, and wrath, and anger, and clamur, and evil ſpeaking be put away from you, with all malice;</hi> put away all of this nature, this is ſowr leaven; <hi>and be ye kind one to another, tender hearted, for giving one another, even as God for Chriſts ſake hath forgiven you:</hi> Have you found the word to be Honey to you, to ſweeten your ſpirits, and make them peaceable, and plyable to the will
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:94121:130"/>of God; it's an argument that you have taſted the ſweetneſs that is in the word of God; and ſo in the 4. <hi>Cant.</hi> 11. where it's ſaid, <hi>Thy lips, O my Spouſe, drop as the Honey-comb:</hi> That is, her words and expreſſions were ſweet, a Law of kindneſs was in her lips; ſo if the word of God have been ſweet to us, there will be ſweetneſs and meekneſs of ſpirit in us, therefore try whether the word have been Honey unto you.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee, that the Statutes, and Law of the Lord, they are more to be deſired than Gold; yea, than much fine Gold; ſweeter alſo than Honey, and the Honey-comb: And the Lord make them ſweet to every one of your Souls.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Obſ.</hi> The firſt is, that there is a proneſs even in Saints, to love the world. There would not be a prohibition againſt it, unnleſs there were a proneſs in us to it. Even Chriſtians and Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are too apt and prone to love the world, and the things of the world. There is a great ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs between the world, and our corrupt hearts and natures, Pleaſures, Profits, Honours, and things of that nature, do ſuit with our ſancies, and ſuit with our affections, diſpoſitions, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations; and therefore he ſaith, Love not the world: but this I ſhall not ſtand upon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſ.</hi> The ſecond obſervation, which I ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt upon is this; That thoſe that are in a ſtate of Grace, be they little Children, or be they young Men, or be they Fathers, they are not to love the world. <hi>Love not the World, nor the things that are in the world.</hi>

            <p>By <hi>world</hi> in the firſt place, is meant the viſible Heavens and Earth, with all the creatures in them,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:94121:132"/>as they came out of the hand of God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.1. <hi>In the beginning God created the Heavens and the Earth;</hi> and afterwards he tells you of particulars that were created, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.3. It's ſaid, <hi>By him all things were made,</hi> and verſe 10. <hi>he was in the world, and the world was made by him.</hi> The world, and all things were made by Chriſt, God imployed Chriſt in making of the world, and the things of the world. So that all the viſible things in this world, are the workmanſhip of God and Chriſt, and are underſtood by the word <hi>World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, By <hi>world,</hi> is meant the cuſtoms, and manners, the worſhip, and faſhions of the world. Rom. 12.2. <hi>Be not conformed to the world, but be transformed:</hi> that is, be not conformed to the cuſtoms and manners of the world, to the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the world, and faſhions of the world. So world is uſed there. And in the 2 <hi>Col.</hi> 20. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if ye be dead with Chriſt from the Rudiments of the world, why as though living in the world are ye ſubject to Ordinances, after the Commandments and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of men.</hi> By <hi>world</hi> is underſtood the Rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of men, the Ordinances of men, the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of men, and wayes of men in the worſhip of God: So that <hi>world</hi> doth imply the cuſtoms, faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, manners, and worſhip of the world; and in the <hi>Galatians,</hi> they are called weak and beggerly Elements, the traditions and inventions of men.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, By World is meant the pomp and ſplendor of the world, the glory and greatneſs of the world, whether in men, or other creatures; as the excellencies and gifts of Men, the profits and pleaſures of the World, which Satan makes uſe of to further his Kingdom and Intereſt, and
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:94121:132"/>to hinder the Kingdom and Intereſt of Chriſt. So in <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.14. ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> there, <hi>God forbid that I ſhould glory, ſave in the Croſs of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.</hi> I am crucified unto the pomp, and glory, and ſplendor of the world, and all that's goodly in the world, and the world is crucified unto me; it's a dead thing unto me, and I am a dead thing unto it. <hi>Demas</hi> embraced the world, the things, the pleaſures, the profits, the honours, the comforts, the contents of the world; So then, love not the world. Dont love the creatures of the world, the cuſtoms and faſhions of the world, the ſplendor, and pomp, and glory of the world; the worſhip of the world. Theſe are all under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood here.</p>
            <p>Now what is it to love the world?</p>
            <p>Firſt, To love the world, is highly to eſteem of the world, to have the world in a high account; For Chriſt ſaith, <hi>The things that are of high account with men, are abomination with God.</hi> When we have the world, and the things of it in high eſteem, and in high account, this is to Love the world. As thoſe in the 14. <hi>Luk.</hi> when they were invited to the great Feaſt, they had their Farms, their Oxen, their Wives, the things of the world, in higher account than the things of Chriſt. When theſe are highly eſteemed we are ſaid to love the world. Many men would think themſelves made if they had the world; I were happy if I had ſuch an Eſtate, ſuch Honours, ſuch Greatneſs, I were made. In the 144. <hi>Pſal.</hi> from the 12. verſe to the end, <hi>That our Sons may be as plants grown up in their youth; that our Daughters may be as corner ſtones
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:94121:133"/>poliſhed after the ſimilitude of a Palace: That our Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners may be full, affording all manner of ſtore; that our Sheep may bring forth thouſands, and ten thouſands in our ſtreets: That our Oxen may be ſtrong to labour, that there be no breaking in, nor going out; that there be no complaining in our ſtreets. Happy is that people that is in ſuch a caſe. David</hi> ſpeaks in the perſon of the men of the world; They are happy men who have all proſperous and ſucceſsful. But he corrects it, <hi>Happy is that people whoſe God is the Lord. Jonas</hi> highly eſteemed his Gourd, that periſhed in anight. The Jews highly eſteemed their Temple; ſo that we are ſaid to love the world, when we ſet a high value and eſtimation upon the things of the world.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We love the world, when we have our thoughts much upon the world, what any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons love, that their thoughts are much upon. <hi>O how I love thy Law</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) it is my medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation all the day.</hi> What we love, our medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are moſt upon: Now when our thoughts are moſt upon the world, we love the world and the things of it; 'tis in our thoughts early and late. Men are full of the thoughts of the world, the pleaſures, the honours, the profits, the contents, the delights of the world; their thoughts are taken up with them. <hi>James</hi> 4.13. <hi>Go to now, ye that ſay, to day or to morrow we will go into ſuch a City, and continue there a year, and buy and ſell, and get gain.</hi> Their thoughts were much upon the world, buying and ſelling, and getting of gain, and thus they teſtified their love unto the world. So in the 49. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 11. <hi>Their inward thought is, that their houſes ſhall continue for ever, and their dwelling places
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:94121:133"/>to all Generations, they call their lands after their own Names.</hi> Their inward thoughts: All their thoughts were taken up with theſe things, and buſied about theſe things, which argued their love of the world, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.19. <hi>Earthly minded men,</hi> when mens minds are upon the earth, and the things of the world, they love the earth, and they love the world; they are Inhabitants of the earth, they are of the earth; and that's a ſecond thing wherein the love of the world conſiſts, to have our thoughts taken up with the world, and minding the world, and carried towards the world.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Men are ſaid to love the world, when their deſires are after the world: what men and women love, they deſire much; their deſires are ſtrong that way, and run after thoſe things. Love is a deſire of union too, or with the thing loved. They are carried unto the thing: you know what's ſaid in the Commandments, <hi>Thou ſhalt not covet thy Neighbours Houſe, Thouſhalt not covet thy Neighbours Wife, nor his Man-ſervant, nor his Maid-ſervant, nor his Ox, nor his Aſs, nor any thing that is thy Neighbours.</hi> When there is a covetous deſire in the ſoul, that ſhews the ſoul is in love with the thing, O now the deſires of men are carried after the things of the world, ſtrongly affecting the things of the world.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The love of the world is in this, in ſetting the heart upon the things of the world; when the heart is ſetled upon things, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62.10. <hi>If riches increaſe, ſet not your hearts upon them.</hi> Many ſet their hearts upon the things of the world, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.17. Ephraim <hi>is joyned to Idols;</hi> his heart is ſet upon his Idols, when the heart is
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:94121:134"/>ſet upon things, there's loving of them; you know what <hi>Samuel</hi> ſaid to <hi>Saul, Set not thine heart upon thy Fathers Aſſes.</hi> Mens hearts are ſet upon their goods, and their cattel, and their corn, and wine, and oyl, and their pleaſures and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, and thoſe things that the world holds out. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Set your affections upon things above, and not upon the things on the earth.</hi> Men <hi>ſet</hi> and <hi>ſettle</hi> their affections upon the things of the earth, one thing or other here below ſteals away the hearts, and the hearts are taken up with them, and ſo they love them. In the 24. <hi>Matth.</hi> 38. <hi>As in the dayes that were before the flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage.</hi> Their affections were ſet upon thoſe things. When the affection is ſet upon any thing, we love the thing.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, We are ſaid to love the world, when we imploy the chiefeſt, or moſt of our ſtrength, in, and upon, and about the things of the world; when our chiefeſt ſtrength is imployed about them, our time and ſtrength goes out moſt that way. In the 6. <hi>Joh.</hi> 27. <hi>Labour not for the meat which periſheth,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>but for that meat which endureth unto everlaſting life, which the Son of man ſhall give unto you,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Labour not]</hi> when our chief labour is about meat that periſhes, and upon theſe things, we love them. When the bent of the ſoul is that way, when men riſe early, and lye down late, and ſpend their time that way. In the 13. <hi>Rom. Make no proviſion for the fleſh, to fulfil the luſt thereof.</hi> When we make proviſion for the fleſh, and the luſts thereof, to fulfil them, to gratifie them, and ſatisfie them, 'tis an Argument that we
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:94121:134"/>love the world: men follow it with eagerneſs, their time and ſtrength are improved that way.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, We are ſaid to love the world, when as we do watch all opportunities and occaſions to get the things of the world; to buy cheap, and ſell dear; to get great eſtates, and houſes, and lands, and things of that nature. <hi>The Children of this world</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>are wiſer in their Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than the Children of light.</hi> The Children of the world are wiſe in their generation to get all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages whereby to raiſe themſelves. In the 8. <hi>Amos</hi> 4. <hi>Hear this, O ye that ſwallow up the needy, even to make the poor of the Land to fail.</hi> They do watch advantages even to ſwallow up the needy, to make a prey of the needy, and to have their labour for a ſong, and for nothing. They ſwallow up the needy, and make the poor of the Land to fail: They are like unto the Eagle, or unto the Kite, that ſores aloft, and looks downward to ſeize upon the prey; the heart ranges and roves abroad after ſomething or other in the world to ſettle upon. In the 12. <hi>Luke</hi> 29. <hi>Seek not ye what ye ſhall eat, or what ye ſhall drink, neither be ye of doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful mind.</hi> Be not like Meteors in the air, that hover there, and then fall upon the earth; ſo many are like Meteors in the air, hovering about, and at laſt they fall upon the earth.</p>
            <p>Some do ſay, if I had gotten ſuch an eſtate, then I would take my eaſe, and be at reſt; as in the 18. <hi>Prov.</hi> 10, 11. ſaith the wiſe man there, <hi>The rich mans wealth is his ſtrong City, and as a high wall in his own conceit.</hi> A rich man when he hath gotten wealth, he will ſettle upon it, it's <hi>his
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:94121:135"/>ſtrong City,</hi> he will reſt there, <hi>it's as a high wall in his own conceit;</hi> 'tis a wall to defend him againſt all his enemies, and all injuries and wrongs. So then, we love the world when we watch advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and hover over the things of the world, to get ſomething to reſt upon, and confide in, and truſt in, and ſecure our ſelves by.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, We love the world when we can endure great hardſhips for it, and the things of it: That which we love, we will endure any thing to accompliſh it. <hi>Jacob</hi> he loves <hi>Rachel;</hi> and he will endure cold and heat, Winter and Summer to accompliſh his deſires. So when men can endure great difficulties, and run through great dangers, and venture upon any thing to get the world, they do love the world. It's ſaid of Souldiers, they will venture their limbs and lives for eight pence a day. And hoſe that are <hi>Duellers</hi> will venture their ſouls for their credit; 'tis not their credit, their honour, to put up an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, or a wrong, but they muſt venture the haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of their lives and ſouls to maintain their credit and honour. In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107.23, 24, 25, 26, 27. you may ſee how men endure the dangers and the ſtorms at Sea: <hi>They that go down to the Sea in Ships, and do buſineſs in great waters, they ſee the works of the Lord, and his wonders in the deep. For he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth and raiſeth the ſtormy wind, which lifteth up the waves thereof. They mount up to the Heaven, they go down again to the depths, their ſoul is melted becauſe of trouble.</hi> They endure trouble even that melts their very ſouls. <hi>They reel too and fro, and ſtagger like a Drunken man, and are at their wits end.</hi> Men will endure any thing at Sea to get the wealth of
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:94121:135"/>the world, which argues the love of the world: All the difficulties that they meet with, will not quench their love; though they meet with ſtorms and waves, and dangers, yet it doth not quench their love to the world; they are not weary of any thing ſo they may get the world. But as for the things of God, and of the Soul, the Goſpel, and the Sabbath, how ſoon are men weary of theſe, <hi>Amos</hi> 8.5. <hi>Hear this, ye that ſwallow up the needy;</hi> you ſay, <hi>when will the new Moon be gone, that we may ſell Corn, and the Sabbath that we may ſet forth wheat, making the Ephah ſmall, and the Shekel great and falſifie the ballances by deceit.</hi> They are not weary of the world, but ſoon weary of the new Moon, and weary of the Sabbaths, and of the Ordinances of God. Men can endure any diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and dangers to get eſtates, but will hardly endure any thing to get Heaven, and Grace, and Intereſt in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, Men love the world, when they ſavour much, or moſt of the world. When they ſavour moſt of the world in their diſcourſes, and the things of the world, they are of the world. Chriſt tells you, out of the abundance of the heart the tongue ſpeaks. When the world's in the heart, the heart loves it: Now it's an argument the world's in the heart when mens diſcourſes are of the world, and ſavour moſt of the world. In <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.31. ſaith the Lord Chriſt, he that cometh from above, is above all, <hi>he that is of the earth, is earthly, and ſpeaketh of the earth.</hi> He that is of the earth, is earthly: when men are of the earth, worldly, and love the world; they are earthly, and ſpeak of the earth, and ſavour the things of the
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:94121:136"/>earth. How ſavory are diſcourſes of gain, and pleaſures, and honours to them. In <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.23. <hi>And he ſaid unto them, ye are from beneath, I am from above; ye are of this world, I am not of this world.</hi> Chriſt was not of the world, and he was ſpeaking of heaven and heavenly things, and the things that concern the eternal good of mens ſouls; but they were of the earth, and ſpake of the earth. He ſpeaks of the Scribes and Phariſes, how they did love the applauſe of men, and vain glory, and ſought high places, and upper rooms, and things of that nature. They were of the earth, and therefore ſavoured the things of the earth, and ſpake of them; but Chriſt he was of heaven, and ſpake of heavenly things. They were minding of their Cummin, and Anniſe, and Mint, and Tythes, and neglected the weighty things of the Law; their hearts were upon thoſe things. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.5. ſaith he, they are of the world, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſpeak they of the world, and the world heard them: Men that are of the world, that love the world, they ſpeak of the world, and men love to hear them ſpeak of the world: And when any ſpeak of heavenly things, how unwelcome and unſavory are they? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. <hi>The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are fooliſhneſs unto him, neither can he know them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned.</hi> They do not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the things of God, nor receive the things of God, they are ſpiritual and unwelcome unto them. Therefore in the 8. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5, 6. ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>They that are after the fleſh, do ſavour the things of the fleſh;</hi> they ſavour them, reliſh them, and delight in them; but <hi>they that are after the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:94121:136"/>do ſavour the things of the Spirit:</hi> and in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.13. <hi>If thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath, from doing thy pleaſure on my Holy day, and call the Sabbath a delight, The Holy of the Lord, Honourable, and ſhalt honour him, not doing thine own wayes, nor finding thine own pleaſure, nor ſpeaking thine own words.</hi> God accounts that man a gracious man, a heavenly man, a good man, that turns his foot away from the Sabbath, from finding his own pleaſure, and doing his own will, and calls the Sabbath a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and honourable, and doth not his own work and will, nor ſpeaks his own words. Now our own words, are the words of the world, the words of the fleſh. It's an Argument a man is not of the world, when he ſavours the things of God, and turns away his feet from the Sabbath, from doing his pleaſure on Gods Holy day, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But when a man reliſhes, and ſavors the world and the things of it, in his diſcourſes, this ſhews we are glewed to the world, and love the world.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, A man loves the world, when he doth mourn and lament for the things of the world being taken from him. That which we love, we mourn when we loſe it; when men mourn ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly for a child, it's an argument they lov'd their child; ſo when men mourn and are afflicted for the loſs of Eſtate, Names, Friends, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations; it's an argument they loved the world. <hi>Rachel</hi> weeps, and refuſes to be comforted, why her Children are not. Many, how greatly are they afflicted when they loſe ſome outward things, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>redit, profit, honours, pleaſures, eſtates, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ted, and hang down the head, and will not
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:94121:137"/>be comforted. They love the world, and the things of the world.</p>
            <p>Tenthly, Laſtly, we are ſaid to love the world, when men are reſolved to be rich, and will have the world one way or other; they will have the world by hook or by crook (as we uſe to ſay) 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.9. They that <hi>Will</hi> be rich: They are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to be rich, and to have the world whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever comes of it. Theſe men love the world in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. Thus then you ſee what the world is, and what it is to love the world.</p>
            <p>The next thing is, why we ſhould not love the world, nor the things of the world?</p>
            <p>Firſt, Thoſe that are in a ſtate of grace, be they Babes, little Children, young men, or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, they ſhould not love the world, becauſe they are called out of the world, called off from the world. They are called to another ſtate, to a ſtate of grace; and now their love ſhould run out to grace, and the things of another world, which they are called unto: They are called to be Heirs with Chriſt, and that of Heaven, Glory, and Happineſs, and therefore they ſhould not love the world.</p>
            <p>Secondly, They ſhould not love the world becauſe it will put them upon things that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable: which will be ſeen in tvvo or three particulars.</p>
            <p>Firſt, 'Twill put you upon things that are but probable, and make you leave things that are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. Now this is unreaſonable, to be taken off from things that are certain, and to be put upon things that are but probable. It is but probab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> for any man in this world to get the world; no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <pb n="267" facs="tcp:94121:137"/>to follow hard after that which is but probable whether we ſhall get it or no, <hi>Hag.</hi> 1.6.9. ſaith the Prophet, <hi>ye have ſown much, and bring in little; ye eat, but ye have not enough; ye drink, but ye are not filled with drink; ye cloath you, but there is none warm; and he that earneth wages, earneth wages to put it into a bag with holes,</hi> and v. 9. <hi>Ye looked for much, and loe it came to little; and when ye brought it home, I did blow upon it.</hi> It is a hazzard, a venture to get the things of this world; men may take a great deal of pains, and purſue theſe things eagerly, and yet come ſhort of them. The greateſt part of men dye in their expectations, they look to get theſe things, and do not get them; nay, thoſe that labour moſt, do uſually attain leaſt. And therefore as the wiſe man ſaith, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.11. <hi>I returned and ſaw under the Sun, that the race is not to the Swift:</hi> who ſhould get the race but the <hi>ſwift?</hi> it's moſt probable that the <hi>ſwift</hi> ſhould get the <hi>Race; But the Race is not to the ſwift, nor the Battel to the ſtrong,</hi> neither yet bread to the wiſe, wiſe men dont get bread, nor underſtanding men get riches; nor get favour to men of skill, but time and chance happeneth to them all; 'tis uncertain whether they ſhall get theſe things or no. The World and the Devils promiſes are ſeldom made good, but now for other things they are certain, and therefore it puts men upon unreaſonable things, to leave certain things for improbable things: God's promiſes are certain, God will not fail men that take pains for true Wiſdom and underſtanding; Ask and ye ſhall have, ſeek and ye ſhall find, knock and it ſhall be opened unto you. Firſt, ſeek theſe things for they are certain.</p>
            <pb n="268" facs="tcp:94121:138"/>
            <p> Secondly, Suppoſe we do get the world with our endeavours, yet we cannot keep them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fear of loſing them, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.4, 5. <hi>Wilt thou ſet thine Eyes upon that which is not, for riches certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make themſelves wings, they flee away as an Eagle towards Heaven.</hi> Wilt thou ſet thine Eyes upon that which is not, which is not conſiderable, which is not long to continue, <hi>Riches certainly makes themſelves wings,</hi> others need not make them wings. <hi>And they flee away as an Eagle towards Heaven,</hi> Prov. 27.1. <hi>Boaſt not thy ſelf of to morrow, for thou knoweſt not what a day may bring forth.</hi> To morrow may be a great ſtorm, and may blow down the houſe; a great Tempeſt, and the Ship be overturned, or driven upon an Anchor, and all the goods be loſt; to morrow may be a fire in thine houſe, therefore wilt thou ſet thine Eyes upon that which is not. But if we get grace, that will continue with us; if we get peace and joy, none can take them from us; if we get intereſt in Chriſt, none can pluck us out of his hand.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Suppoſe we do get them, and we can keep them, yet they will not ſatisfie our ſouls; and therefore to be put upon that which will not ſatisfie, and let go that which will ſatisfie the ſoul, is unreaſonable, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5.10. <hi>He that loveth Silver ſhall not be ſatisfied therewith.</hi> If we love the world, the honours, the pleaſures, or any thing in the world, we ſhall not be ſatisfied with it; for every creature hath a cranny in it; yea, there is a curſe goes along with it. In the 6. <hi>Mich.</hi> 14, 15. <hi>Thou ſhalt eat, but not be ſatisfied; and thy caſting down ſhall be in the midſt of thee.</hi> Thou ſhalt be caſt down, though thou getteſt never ſo much;
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:94121:138"/>
               <hi>And that which thou delivereſt will I give up to the Sword. Thou ſhalt ſow, but thou ſhalt not reap; thou ſhalt tread the Olives, but thou ſhalt not anoint thee with oyl; and ſweet wine, but ſhalt not drink wine.</hi> There's a vacuum in all creatures, every creature hath but dry breaſts, it will not yield that which we expect and look for at it: There is not that in Riches, and Honours, or Trades, or Health, or Wives, or Children, or Eſtates, which men ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect. <hi>Haman</hi> had great honour, and greatneſs in the world, as much as a man could deſire; yet he wants <hi>Mordecai</hi>'s cruſe, and that doth ſow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> all unto him: There is vanity and vexation in all eſtates and conditions: <hi>Solomon</hi> hath written that Inſcription upon all things here in the world, Vanity of vanities, all is vanity and vexation of ſpirit. Therefore to love the world and the things of it, puts us upon unreaſonable things: But now the things of God are better than the things of the world.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, it puts us upon the worſt things: all the things in the world are periſhing things, but the things of God are durable things: Theſe things are but <hi>Dogs meat</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> calls them; but the things of God, and of Heaven, and of the Kingdom, they are excellent things: There's an excellency in grace, there's an excellency in the knowledge of Chriſt; now we let theſe things go, and chooſe the other: that's unreaſonable.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, We ſhould not love the world, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it's ſcandalous to the wayes and things of God: when profeſſors are as the men of the world, it is a ſcandal unto the wayes of God. To love it, and the things of it; ſo that nothing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:94121:139"/>but a profeſſion of Religion, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Having a form of Godlineſs, but denying the power.</hi> Who are thoſe that have a form of Godlineſs but deny the power? Covetous men, lovers of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures more than lovers of God. Now this brings a great ſcandal upon the wayes of God, that men of the world ſay, theſe Profeſſors are as covetous as any, love the world as much as any, and early up, and down late, and as greedy after the things of the world as any others whatſoever; what's in their Religion? ſo that hereby Religion ſuffers. The Spies brought up an ill report upon the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> So theſe bring up an ill report upon God and his Ordinances, upon the Milk and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney that is in that Land indeed. They are ready to ſay, ſuch and ſuch are great profeſſors, and make a noiſe in the world, but Silver comes from them as a joynt from the body, as blood from their veins; they are ſo hard, that there's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be gotten from them. In <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.7. <hi>Woe be to the world becauſe of offences:</hi> And one of the great offences that comes, is from Profeſſors, becauſe they love the world ſo much.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, As it is ſcandalous, ſo it is idolatrous, when men love the world, they make an Idol of the world. The world hath their hearts, their heart is glewed to the world. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.5. <hi>Nor cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous man, who is an Idolater:</hi> and in the 3d. <hi>Colloſ.</hi> he tells you that covetouſneſs is Idolatry. We cry out of the Papiſts, that they ſet up Images and Pictures, and bow to them; and we are greater Idolaters our ſelves, if we love the world and the things of the world. We ſet up Idols and Pictures in our hearts; and certainly Idolatry is a great
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:94121:139"/>ſin, and an Idolater is a grievous ſinner. We would be loath to have that imputation faſtened upon us to be Idolaters, and yet if we love the world we are Idolaters, and live in Idolatry.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, It's a dangerous thing to love the world: A man that loves the world, whoſe bent is that way, is in danger of two or three things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A man that loves the world, by little and little grows a ſtranger to God, a ſtranger to Chriſt; we cannot at once have our eyes upon Heaven and upon Earth too. When we are between two men, or two moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, the nearer we draw to one, the further we go off from the other; So the further we go off from God, the more we love the world. When men do love the Ciſtern, they leave the Fountain; all the creatures they are but Ciſterns, and when our hearts run out to theſe, then we leave God who is the Fountain.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another evil is, that we grow acquainted with the worlds wayes, and the wayes of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings: we grow acquainted with their ſhifts, and their over-reachings, and their plots and deſigns and cuſtoms, and many times with their oaths and wicked courſes, and we are defiled and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened thereby.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We expoſe our ſelves to divers Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Snares which are hurtful: Thoſe that will be rich, fall into a ſnare, and into a tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and many hurtful luſts; 'tis a thouſand to one, if we dont loſe a good Conſcience thereby. Nay, we are in danger of loſing our very ſouls by loving the world and the things of the world.
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:94121:140"/>In the 19. <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. <hi>Then ſaid Jeſus unto his Diſciples, verily, I ſay unto you, that a rich man ſhall hardly enter into the Kingdom of Heaven:</hi> What a danger is that man in that loves the world and the things of the world? in danger of loſing Heaven, of loſing his ſoul; what will it profit a man to win the world, and loſe his ſoul? And he that loves the world, he is labouring to get the world, and be great in the world, and ſo to hazzard his ſoul: 'Tis dangerous to love the world.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, We ſhould not love the world, becauſe it puts us upon impoſſibilities, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.24. <hi>No man can ſerve two Maſters; for either he will hate the one, and love the other, or elſe he will hold to the one and deſpiſe the other. Ye cannot ſerve God and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</hi> The Lord Jeſus Chriſt tells you, 'tis an impoſſibility to ſerve God and Mamon: every man ſaith, I will ſerve God, and love God, I were not worthy to live elſe; but if we love the world, we dont ſerve God and love God; we cannot ſerve God and Mamon. Mamon is Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; 'tis an impoſſible thing, and therefore the Lord Chriſt when he was tempted by the Devil, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.10. ſaith he, <hi>Get thee hence Satan, for it is written, Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him onely ſhalt thou ſerve.</hi> I cannot hearken to thy Temptations to imbrace the world; no, 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, him Onely ſhalt thou ſerve; God Onely is to be ſerved, and we cannot ſerve two Maſters; whoſoever loves the world, hath two Maſters to ſerve, God and the world, and 'tis impoſſible to ſerve them both.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, We ſhould not love the world, becauſe hereby we make God our enemy: 'Twas
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:94121:140"/>a ſad thing when God ſaid to <hi>Jer. Behold I am againſt thee,</hi> I am thy enemy; to have the great God, the Lord of Hoſts, the Lord of Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, the Lord of Heaven and Earth to be our Enemy, O dreadful; <hi>whoſoever loves the world, is the enemy of God;</hi> in 4. <hi>James</hi> 4. <hi>Ye Adulterers and Adultereſſes, know ye not that the friendſhip of the world, is enemity with God:</hi> That's more than an Enemy: <hi>Enmity</hi> to God. <hi>Whoſoever therefore will be a friend of the world, is the Enemy of God.</hi> Would you be enemies to God? Love the World. If you would not be enemies to God, dont love the world. Better have all the world our enemy, than God our enemy; all the world to be againſt us, than God to be againſt us. And in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10. It's ſaid, <hi>The covetous whom God abhors.</hi> A man of a covetous heart, and covetous affections, is gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the world, and loves the world, God ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hors him. To have God our enemy, is ſad; what will become of that man or woman that hath God for their enemy. The love of the world doth make God our enemy.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, We ſhould not love the world, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it makes us expenſive of time, which is better than the world. Would any man lay out Gold and Silver for Straws, and Stubble, and Chips, and Butterflyes, and ſuch things as theſe? Thoſe that love the world are at greater expences than the world is worth; and they give that for the world which is better than the world. The beſt things of the world, are the riches, and honours, and pleaſures, and preferments, and learning, and gifts; but now our ſouls are better than all theſe, better than the whole world. <hi>What
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:94121:141"/>ſhall a man give in exchange for his ſoul?</hi> all the world is not worth one ſoul; one ſoul is worth a Million of worlds. Now to lay out our time, ſtrength, underſtandings, and ſouls about the world and the things of the world, what expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are we at? we give too much for the world; the world is not worthy of our affections, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, ſtrengths, hearts; therefore ſee what the Prophet ſaith, in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.2. he comes there with a vehement expoſtulation; <hi>wherefore do you ſpend money for that which is not bread?</hi> 'Tis not <hi>bread,</hi> when you get it. It's not any thing will ſatisfie or advantage your ſouls: <hi>And you labour for that which ſatisfieth not.</hi> So that we are at too great coſt, and too great expences, when we love the world, and labour to get the world, and buy it at ſo dear a rate.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, We ſhould not love the world, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it imbaſeth the underſtanding, that moſt noble faculty of the ſoul. The world doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſe our underſtandings, and imbaſe our ſpirits; our underſtanding was made and given us for God, and for heavenly things, that we might have Communion with God by virtue of our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and reaſon, and apprehenſion, and fall in with God. Now if the <hi>Body</hi> be for God, as in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.13. much more the ſoul, and the underſtanding is for God, and for heavenly things; and not for the Earth, and earthly things. Now the world doth imbaſe our underſtandings, for what is the world? it's a meer dirty thing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.20.22. You ſhall ſee that the world is ſubject to corruption, ſubject to vanity; the world is in bondage to corruption, and the world lyes in
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:94121:141"/>wickedneſs. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.19. It lyes like a piece of Carrion in a Ditch; it lyes <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, in the wicked one, in the Devil. And what can the world contribute to your underſtanding now to do you good? No, it imbaſes the underſtanding, and makes the ſoul earthly, droſſy, muddy, and miery. Now will you imbaſe a noble Soul to a dirty World? in <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. There is mention made of a great Image, and what was the beſt of that Image? the Feet are Clay, and the Legs are Iron, and the Thighs are Braſs, and the Belly is Silver, and the Head is Gold; the beſt is but Gold and Silver, and they are ruſty things, periſhing things, and theſe do imbaſe a noble Heroical Soul to be bowed down to theſe things; for the Soul becomes that which it loves; if it loves the earth, it is an earthly ſoul.</p>
            <p>Tenthly, The world it is of a damning nature, and therefore we ſhould not love it. The world doth not onely <hi>indanger</hi> us, but it <hi>drowns the ſoul in perdition.</hi> 1 Tim. 6.9. <hi>They that will be rich, fall into Temptation, and a Snare, and into many fooliſh and hurtful luſts, which drown men in deſtruction and perdition.</hi> The ſoul is drown'd in perdition; who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is a lover of the world, is a child of the world, and ſo is a Son of perdition. It's ſaid of the man of ſin, he is a Son of perdition; the world doth make men leave Chriſt; in the 19. <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. There's a young man comes to Chriſt; Maſter, what ſhall I do to inherit eternal life, keep the Commandments, ſaith Chriſt. He ſaith unto him, which? Jeſus ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt do no Murther, Thou ſhalt not commit Adultery,</hi> &amp;c. The young man ſaith unto him, all theſe things
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:94121:142"/>have I kept from my youth up; what lack I yet; Jeſus ſaith unto him, if thou wilt be perfect, go and ſell that thou haſt, and give to the poor, (and thou ſhalt have treaſure in Heaven) and come and follow me; but he leaves Chriſt, he went away ſorrowful, ſaith the Text; why, he had great Poſſeſſions. So the Scribes and Phariſes, they leave Chriſt for their Credit, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.42, 43. So in the 8. <hi>Matth.</hi> 34. The <hi>Gadarens</hi> deſire Chriſt to be gone out of their Countrey, they would have none of Chriſt; but they loved their Swine which were drown'd in the Sea, and the world drown'd them in perdition.</p>
            <p>Eleventhly, The world is a great enemy to growth in grace, and Communion with God; for the world and the things of it divert the heart from ſpiritual things. <hi>Martha</hi> is cumbred about many things, and diverted from Chriſt, and hearing of him. So in <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.22. <hi>He alſo</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>that received ſeed among the Thornes, is he that heareth the word: and the cares of this world, and the deceitfulneſs of riches choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful.</hi> So that the love of the world, and the things of the world, are a great enemy to growing in grace, and to Communion with God. It makes men to leave the beſt things, and moſt excellent things, even Grace it ſelf, and God himſelf, and Communion with God. A worldly heart hath little or no Communion with God. If a Woman fall in love with another, and commit folly with another, her Husband cares not for Communion with her; ſo is it here, <hi>ye Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers and Adultereſſes, know ye not that the friendſhip of the world is enmity with God, whoſoever therefore will
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:94121:142"/>be a friend of the world, is the enemy of God.</hi> Pſal. 73.27. They went a whoring from under God. Men go a whoring from God when they love the world, and dote upon the world, and the things of it. Now what an enemy is the world to growth in grace, and Communion with God.</p>
            <p>Twelfthly, The world is the Devils Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whereby he enſnares men and women, and leads them captive at his pleaſure; he is called the God of the world, and he takes men with the world. The world is his grand Inſtrument to take men and women. In <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.8, 9. he thought to catch Chriſt with the glory of the world, <hi>The Devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and ſheweth him all the Kingdoms of the World, and the glory of them.</hi> Here was his laſt bait whereby he thought to catch Chriſt; <hi>And ſaith unto him, all theſe things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worſhip me.</hi> He thought to catch Chriſt with it, but the Lord Chriſt was too hard for him; but 'tis his Inſtrument whereby he catches men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. Thus he caught <hi>Eve</hi> by the fruit of the Garden; thus he caught <hi>David</hi> by <hi>Bathſheba;</hi> and thus he caught <hi>Achan</hi> by a Wedg of Gold, and a <hi>Babiloniſh</hi> Garment: And thus he catches men and women, ſome by Wine, ſome by Women, ſome by Kingdoms, and he leads them captive when he hath taken them, by ſome bait or other of the world; ſomething or other he preſents ſutable to the eye, to the taſte, to the fancy, or to their opinion: he preſents ſomething or other ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, by which he leads them Captive at his will.</p>
            <p n="13">
               <pb n="278" facs="tcp:94121:143"/> 13. Laſtly, We ſhould not love the world, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is that which cauſes men to erre and go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtray from the truth, and from the wayes of God, and leads them to Apoſtacy in the end: 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.10. <hi>The Love of money is the root of all evil; which while ſome coveted after, they have erred from the faith.</hi> Mark, they have erred from the faith, if we love the world, we will let the <hi>faith</hi> go, and truth go, and the wayes of God go, and ſo we make way for Apoſtacy: what was it cauſed <hi>Spira</hi> to renounce the faith (whoſe ſtory you have heard of, and is among you) it was the love of the world, of his credit and eſteem, and outward engagements that he had, Theſe made him to renounce the faith. And ſo <hi>Demas,</hi> 2 Tim. 4.10. Demas <hi>hath forſaken me,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, and embrac'd the preſent world.</hi> What forſake <hi>Paul</hi> that great Apoſtle, brought up at the feet of <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> a man wrapt up into the third Heavens, a man of that note that <hi>Paul</hi> was, to forſake him for the preſent world? yet <hi>Demas</hi> did it; the Love of the world drew him off from <hi>Paul</hi> and his Doctrine, and Church, State, and wayes; the Devil by that means drew him away. So then you ſee the reaſons why we ſhould not love the world, nor the things of the world. But now a Queſtion or two comes to be anſwered.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> What muſt we then quite caſt off the world, and have nothing to do with the world?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> I anſwer, not ſo neither; 'tis not ſaid here, we may <hi>not have</hi> the world; but we muſt <hi>not love</hi> the world: We may have to do with the world. I ſhall anſwer this queſtion in three or four things.</p>
            <pb n="279" facs="tcp:94121:143"/>
            <p> Firſt, We may ſtudy the world, make it a part of our ſtudy; we may ſtudy the works of God in the world, they are honourable, ſought out of all them that have pleaſure therein; we may ſtudy the world, for the world will teach us many good leſſons.</p>
            <p>Firſt, We may ſtudy the world, and come to the knowledge of the inviſible things of God by theſe viſible things, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20. <hi>For the inviſible things of him from the Creation of the world, are cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeen, being underſtood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and God-head; ſo that they are without excuſe.</hi> We may come to know there is an eternal God, an Omnipotent God, by theſe viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things; and in the 12. <hi>Job.</hi> 7, 8. <hi>Ask now the Beaſts and they ſhall teach thee, and the fowls of the Air and they ſhall tell thee, or ſpeak to the Earth and it ſhall teach thee, and the Fiſhes of the Sea ſhall declare unto thee.</hi> Theſe will teach us ſomething; the Beaſts, and the Fowls, and the Earth, and the Fiſhes will teach us the inviſible things of God, and inſtruct us in thoſe things may do us good. There's ſomething to be learned from theſe, therefore we may ſtudy theſe; God's power, wiſdom, goodneſs, mercy, are all learned by the creatures.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The creatures do teach us prudence, and providence. Go to the Ant thou Sluggard, he layes up in Summer againſt Winter.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The creatures will teach us to do the will of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.91. <hi>They Continue to this day according to thy Ordinances, for all are thy Servants.</hi> They all ſerve thee: The Sun, and Moon, and Stars, they all ſerve the Lord, and
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:94121:144"/>the Winds do ſerve the Lord, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 148.8. <hi>Stor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my winds fulfil his Word.</hi> The very winds do fulfill the word of God, and obey his voice, and do what he commands them to do. They teach us therefore to do the will of God; ſhall the waves, and winds, and all the creatures obey the Lord, and ſhall not man obey the Lord for whom all theſe were made.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, They teach us to <hi>wait</hi> upon God, 145. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15. <hi>The eyes of all wait upon thee,</hi> that thou mayeſt give them their meat in due ſeaſon; the fowls of the heaven wait upon God; the very <hi>Leviathan</hi> in the Sea waits upon God for its meat in due ſeaſon. And what ſhall we be carking and caring about what ſhall we eat, and what ſhall we drink, and wherewith ſhall we be cloathed: who feeds the <hi>Wild fowl</hi> in the air? the Lord feeds them; and therefore they teach us to wait upon God without carking, and being diſtracted, and deſponding.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, The creatures do teach us to expect glorious liberty from the hand of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.14.21. <hi>The earneſt expectation of the creature, waiteth for the manifeſtation of the Sons of God;</hi> and <hi>v.</hi> 21. They wait to be delivered into the glorious liberty of the Children of God: there is a glorious liberty for the Children of God to come to: they may be in bondage, and are at this day; but there is a liberty, and a glorious liberty; and ſhall not we wait for it, when the whole creation waits for it.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Laſtly, The creature teaches us to know times and ſeaſons; the Stork, the Crane, and the Swallow they know their times and ſeaſons, and ſhall not we know times and part
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:94121:144"/>ſeaſons. We are therefore to make it a part of our ſtudy, to ſtudy the world, and the creatures.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We may pray for the things of this world, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.8. <hi>Agur</hi> prayes there, <hi>Remove far from me vanity and lyes; give me neither poverty nor riches, feed me with food convenient for me;</hi> you ſee here he prayes for food convenient. So in <hi>Luke</hi> 11. Chriſt teaches us to pray, <hi>Give us day by day, our daily bread;</hi> that is, things needful for this life, needful for my ſtate and condition, and relation that I am in.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, We muſt follow a calling in this world, and uſe lawful means to obtain the things of the world, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.10.12. The Apoſtle or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders there, <hi>If any man work not, neither ſhould he eat. Now them that are ſuch, we command and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that with quietneſs they work, and eat their own bread.</hi> The Lord commands and orders it ſo; men are to have a calling, and to follow a calling, and to be diligent in their calling, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.33. <hi>He that is Married, careth for the things of this world, how he may pleaſe his Wife.</hi> He ought to take care, and to pleaſe his wife, and provide for his wife and Children, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.8. <hi>He that provides not for his own, and eſpecially for thoſe of his own houſe, he hath denyed the Faith, and is worſe than an Infidel,</hi> and they ought ſo to labour, as they may have wherewith to relieve others, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.28. <hi>Let him that ſtole, ſteal no more; but rather let him labour, working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needeth.</hi> Men ought to have a calling, and follow a calling, and ſo to follow it, that they may not live upon others, and be idle; but have to relieve
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:94121:145"/>others, and help others that are impotent, or aged, and ſick, and weak, or made poor by the providence of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.35. <hi>It is more bleſſed to give then to receive.</hi> Men ſhould labour therefore to have, that ſo they may give rather than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, We may <hi>uſe</hi> the world, it's not ſaid here, <hi>uſe not the world,</hi> but <hi>love not</hi> the world, nor the things of it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.31. And they that <hi>uſe this world,</hi> as not abuſing it. Men indeed do abuſe the world to gratifie their luſts, and to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the fleſh; as in the next verſe, <hi>All that is in the world, the luſt of the fleſh, the luſt of the eyes, and the pride of life,</hi> is not of the Father, but is of the world, we may uſe the world, but not abuſe it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> Now the next queſtion is, when doth a man ſo uſe the world, as not to abuſe it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An.</hi> I anſwer, firſt, a man doth not abuſe the the world, but uſe it well and right when he uſes all things for that end that God hath made them. Now in <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.4. you ſhall ſee for what end God hath made the world. <hi>He hath made all things for himſelf;</hi> God hath made all things, and all things in this world for himſelf, for his own praiſe, and honour, and glory; and therefore in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. <hi>Whether ye eat, or drink, or whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ye do, do all to the Glory of God.</hi> Let God be glorified in your eating, and drinking, in your recreations, in all your actions, in all your ſufferings, do all to the glory of God, for God hath made all things for himſelf, and in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. <hi>Ye are not your own, ye are bought with a price, glorifie God in your body, and in your ſpirit, which are Gods.</hi>
               <pb n="283" facs="tcp:94121:145"/>When you uſe your underſtandings, your affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, your ſpeech, your eyes, your hands, your feet; when you uſe all to the glory of God: <hi>Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity,</hi> when your <hi>feet run the way of Gods Commandments,</hi> when you uſe all for the glory of God, then you dont abuſe the world, but uſe it a right way.</p>
            <p>Secondly, When we walk with God in the uſe of the world, and the things of it, and anſwer Gods call. It's ſaid of <hi>Enoch,</hi> he walked with God three hundred years; he walked with God in his calling: we are but Stewards, and God calls up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us ever and anon, to do this, and to do that; he calls upon us to give to the poor, we anſwer Gods call: So when God calls upon us to mourn, we mourn; when he calls us to Sympathize with thoſe that ſuffer, we Sympathize; when he calls us to rejoyce, we rejoyce; when we abridge our ſelves of our liberty at Gods call, now we uſe the world aright.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, We uſe the world aright, when we uſe the world and the things of the world to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote ſpiritual good in our ſelves or others, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. <hi>All things work together for good to them that love God, and are called according to his purpoſe.</hi> Now when I uſe the creature to promote my ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual good, the good of my ſoul, to get more grace, to further my peace, and comfort, and content, and communion with God, I uſe the word aright, I uſe it well. <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.16. <hi>Let your light ſo ſhine before men, that they may ſee your good works, and glorifie your Father which is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> When I uſe the world ſo that I make my light to ſhine by it, and ſo to ſhine that men may
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:94121:146"/>ſee my good works, when I do good with my eſtate, that men may glorifie God; now I uſe my eſtate aright. When I make friends of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous <hi>Mammon,</hi> that's uſing the world aright to promote ſpiritual good. Many uſe their eſtates to cruſh others, and to be revenged, and to have their luſts ſatisfied, and ſo they promote the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of Satan; this now is an ill uſe of the world, and the things of the world.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Then I uſe the world aright, when I do uſe the world on the by, and I mind the things of God, and of my Soul, as my main buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: The world is to be minded but on the by; and the things of God, and of the Soul are to be my main buſineſs here in the world. Wherefore hath God ſet me in this world? is it to get riches, and honours, and to have my pleaſures, and to gratifie my luſts? No, but to glorifie his name, and to work out my own ſalvation; now when I make this my main buſineſs, I uſe the world aright. Therefore ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Labour not for the meat that periſheth, but for that meat which endureth to everlaſting life, which the Son of man ſhall give unto you, for him hath God the Father Sealed.</hi> Let that be your main buſineſs to get the bread that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth to everlaſting life, to get grace, to work out your ſalvation, to get aſſurance, and clear evidences for an eternal good condition; this muſt be your main ſcope and buſineſs here in the world, but many look at heaven, and the things of God as things by the by, and they look after the world as the main buſineſs.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Then I uſe the world aright, and dont abuſe it, when my moderation is known that
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:94121:146"/>way, and my affections run out little to the world, when our moderation and affection towards them is ſuch, as if they were not. And this you ſhall ſee plain, in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.29, 30, 31. ſaith he, <hi>It remaineth, that both they that have wives, be as though they had none.</hi> When my moderation, and affection towards a wife, be as though I had none, <hi>and they that weep, as though they wept not;</hi> you are under great and heavy afflictions, but you weep as if you wept not: <hi>And they that rejoyce, as though they rejoyced not.</hi> Have you proſperous times, and all things go well? Be as if you rejoyced not, as if there were no ſuch thing; <hi>And thoſe that buy, as though they poſſeſſed not.</hi> Be as if you had no poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, no houſes, no lands, when you have bought and purchas'd them. <hi>And they that uſe this world, as not abuſing it.</hi> When our moderation is ſuch towards things, as if they were not, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. <hi>Let your moderation be known to all men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sixthly, Laſtly, we uſe the world as not abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it, when we ſo uſe it, that we can give a good and chearful account to God concerning what we have had in the world. God gives ſome men great portions, and ſome men leſs portions; there's none but have ſomething: Now when we uſe our Gifts, our Eſtates, our Relations, ſo that we can give a good account to God; <hi>Come, give account of thy Stewardſhip,</hi> it will be ſaid e'r long to every man and woman, thou haſt had Wife, and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and Parents, and Brethren and Siſters, and health, and ſtrength (and the like) come give account of your Stewardſhip; now when we ſo uſe all that we can give a good and chearful account to God, we have not abuſed the world, but us'd it the right way.</p>
            <pb n="286" facs="tcp:94121:147"/>
            <p> There's a queſtion or two more (before I come to the uſe and application of the point) which is this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> Are not the creatures of God good, and may we not love them being good, for good is the object of love.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An.</hi> To this I anſwer; firſt, that the good in the creature is very little, very little compared to ſpiritual good, or the goodneſs of God. The good of the creature is very little, and ſo little that it cannot make us good; but rather doth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our corruptions, and feed our luſts; for all that is in the world (as he ſaith here) is the luſt of the fleſh, the luſt of the eye, and the pride of life. The things of the world do feed our luſts, and are ſtronger to ſet our corruptions a work, than to further that good is in us; and becauſe the things of the world do divert us from God, or diſcourage us towards good, or corrupt the good is in us, therefore the Lord hath forbid us to love the world, though there be ſome good in the world.</p>
            <p>But Secondly, I anſwer, that we may love the world, and the things thereof, as a man loves his tools to carry on ſome buſineſs of concernment; ſo we may love the world as it may further us in our chief buſineſs; if riches will promote the goſpel, promote and further our ſpiritual inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in Chriſt, our peace, and comfort, and graces; ſo far we may love the world. And,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, We may love the world in ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to God; ſo we may love the world, with a ſubordinate love to God, ſo it hinders not love to God; ſo we may love the good that is in
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:94121:147"/>the world, and in the creature; otherwiſe we muſt not love the world.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> Another queſtion is, whether may a man follow his calling to be rich, and take the calling which will bring in moſt gain: men are in the world, and have their callings in the world, may not a man follow his calling to be rich, and chooſe the calling which will be moſt gainful un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him? This is a common practice of men, they do follow their callings to be rich, and chooſe thoſe callings that may be moſt profitable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An.</hi> But the anſwer to it is negative, they may not do ſo, and I ſhall give you reaſons for it; for,</p>
            <p>Firſt, It is a heatheniſh thing to plead the goodneſs of a calling, from the gain of a calling; 'tis a heatheniſh practice; in the 19. <hi>Acts.</hi> 24, 25. <hi>A certain man named</hi> Demetrius, <hi>a Silver-Smith, which made Silver Shrines for</hi> Diana, <hi>brought no ſmall gain unto the Crafts-men; whom he brought together with the work-men of like occupation, and ſaid, Sirs, ye know that by this craft we have our wealth,</hi> or gain: The Heathens did plead the goodnes of their call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the gain that it brought in unto them; now we ſhould not account a calling good becauſe it's gainful, the very Heathens did ſo. In the 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.3. ſpeaking of falſe Prophets, <hi>Through covetouſneſs ſhall they which feigned words make Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize of you.</hi> Through covetouſneſs: <hi>true</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets are to have their maintenance, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and to live comfortably; but the <hi>end</hi> of their calling is not gain, now the Scripture con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns it, and it was their ſin; they would ſell their ſouls for gain; they car'd not what became
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:94121:148"/>of their ſouls, ſo they might have gain and profit thereby.</p>
            <p>And when two callings do lye before a man, he is not to chooſe that calling will bring moſt gain, but that calling he is moſt fit for, that God hath fitted him for, and given him gifts and talents whereby he may uſe the calling well; So that that's the firſt anſwer unto it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, in callings men muſt aim at the publick good, the good of the Church, the good of State, and not at gain; in the 2. <hi>Neh.</hi> 10. <hi>When Sanballat the Heronite, and Tobiah the Servant, the Ammonite, heard of it, it grieved them exceedingly that there was come a man to ſeek the welfare of the Children of Iſrael. Nehemiah</hi> did not ſeek himſelf, but he ſought the welfare of the children of Iſrael, the publick good, he had his calling, he was governour, and he did ſeek the welfare of the children of Iſrael: and in <hi>Eſth.</hi> 10.3. It's ſaid of <hi>Mordecai. That he ſought the wealth of his people, and ſpeaking peace to all his ſeed.</hi> So every man ſhould make that his main aim, to ſeek the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick good of Church or State; and as a Heathen ſaid, our Countrey, our Parents, our Friends, do challenge part of our eſtates, or of our callings, or of what we get; we are not to be for our ſelves, but for the publick good: ſo in the 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.15. ſaith the Apoſtle there, <hi>I will very gladly ſpend and be ſpent for you; though the more abundantly I love you, the leſs I be loved. Paul</hi> did mind them, and not what they had, he would ſpend and be ſpent for them, he would ſacrifice himſelf if there were occaſion upon their faith, to confirm and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then them, to do them good, to build them up,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:94121:148"/>ſo far was he from ſeeking himſelf in his calling.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, For a man to ſeek to be rich in his calling, and to make that his end, is againſt that great and glorious principle of the Goſpel, ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denyal. It's a great principle, and a glorious truth, ſelf-denyal: in the 16. <hi>Matth.</hi> ſaith our bleſſed Saviour, <hi>v.</hi> 24. If any man will come after me, let him deny himſelf, and take up his Croſe and follow me, he muſt deny himſelf; now if I make gain, or profit my end in my calling, I dont deny my ſelf, but I ſet up my ſelf; and this is complained of by the Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.21. Every man ſeeks his own things, and no man ſeeks the things of Chriſt; every man is for himſelf, his own honour, profit and pleaſure, and dont deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Now ſelf-denyal is a great and glorious truth, that every man and woman ſhould take notice of and put in practice, elſe he is none of the Diſciples of the Lord Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, It is but a baſe and low end, and directly againſt Scripture, for a man to propound gain in his calling to be his end, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.4. <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour not to be rich,</hi> that muſt not be your end; moſt men do labour to be rich, and to be great in the world, but it ſhould not be their end, Labour not to be rich; ſo that it's directly againſt the Scripture it ſelf. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.27. <hi>Labour not for the meat that periſheth, but labour for that which endures to everlaſting life. There</hi> ſhould be a mans end, to labour for the meat that endureth to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life, and not for the meat that periſheth.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Laſtly, men ſhould follow a calling whether they get any gain or no; they are to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a calling, and that to glorifie God: God ſet
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:94121:149"/>
               <hi>Adam</hi> in a calling that he might glorifie him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. <hi>Whether ye eat, or drink, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ye do, do all to the glory of God,</hi> This ſhould be the end of men in their callings, do all to the glory of God. And in the 6. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5, 6, 7. ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſervants in their calling, <hi>Servants, be obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to them that are your Maſters according to the fleſh, with fear and trembling, in ſingleneſs of your heart as unto Chriſt.</hi> They muſt ſerve Chriſt, and glorifie Chriſt in their callings, be they never ſo mean; the loweſt and meaneſt Servant in a fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhould ſerve Chriſt: <hi>Not with Eye-ſervice, as men-pleaſers, but as the Servants of Chriſt, doing the will of God from the heart, with good will doing ſervice, as to the Lord, and not to men.</hi> They ſhould not be men-pleaſers, they ſhould not ſeek themſelves, but ſerve the Lord, and ſeek to honour the Lord, <hi>knowing that whatſoever good thing any man doth, the ſame ſhall he receive of the Lord, whether he be bond or free.</hi> They ſhall have a reward of the Lord if they be right in their callings, and dont make gain &amp; profit to be their aim &amp; end. And ſo much for that queſtion. I ſhall now come to the uſes of the point; that thoſe that are in a ſtate of grace, whether they be little children, or young men, or fathers, ought not to love the world, or the things of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> 1. This doth inform us of the corruption of our natures, which are very prone to love the world, and the things of the world; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God gives a flat prohibition, Love not the world nor the things of the world; intimating that men and women ſince the fall, are moſt prone to lvoe the creature, for in their fall they were turned from God to the creature, to leave the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator,
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:94121:149"/>and to run to the creature; and we are ſo turned to the creature, that we do Idolize the creatures, affect the creatures, dote upon the creature, and ſpend our time and ſtrength about creatures, and forget God and the things of God. The water is not more prone to run downward, nor the fire to go upwards, then our hearts are to run out to creatures, this is common to all men, an univerſal ſickneſs and diſeaſe in all men, and their hearts and natures are exceeding corrupt that are ſo prone to theſe things that are forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den: It ſhould humble us that we are ſo corrupt, and go the wrong way, and mind poor periſhing vain things, and neglect God himſelf, who only can ſay, <hi>I am that I am,</hi> I am Subſtance, and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I am excellency, I am worthy of love, and yet I am not beloved.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If thoſe in a ſtate of grace ſhould not love the world, nor the things of the world, then I infer from hence, that the number of ſuch is very few, there are very few that are truly in the ſtate of grace, very few little children, very few young men, very few fathers, that love not the world; the love of the world is ſo common, that it proclaims to the world they have no grace, or but ſeeming grace, not ſaving grace. <hi>All men ſeek their own,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> &amp; no man the things of Chriſt; 'twas ſo in the Apoſtles dayes, they loved the world &amp; the things of the world, the honours of the world, and the preferments of the world, and places of power, and riches, and pleaſures, and things of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which were ſutable to the fleſh and the old man, they loved theſe, and Chriſt was not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded: ſo in the <hi>Revelations, All the world won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:94121:150"/>after the Beaſt.</hi> 'Tis rare to find a man eſtranged from the world, to live above the world, <hi>Our converſation, ſaith</hi> Paul, <hi>is in Heaven;</hi> where is a man now whoſe converſation is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> our Common-wealth is in heaven, we are Citizens of heaven, our affections are in heaven, our trading is in heaven; 'tis very rare to find ſuch a man.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, If ſuch ſhould not love the world, then thoſe who are gracious &amp; godly ſhould be content with a little of the world; a little of the world ſhould ſerve their turns, a little will ſuffice na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and leſs will ſuffice grace, a little will carry us to our Journeys end, and 'tis not wiſdom to load our ſelves with thick clay when we have a Journey to go, a Race to run. The Apoſtle ſaith in the 13. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. <hi>Let your converſation be without covetouſneſs, and be content with ſuch things as ye have;</hi> You are Chriſtians, you are in a Church ſtate, you are Young men, you are Children, you are Fathes, be content with ſuch things as ye have, and be not covetous after the world, and the things of the world; and in the 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.7. <hi>We brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out, and having food and rayment, let us be therewith content.</hi> A gracious heart ſhould conſider, I brought nothing into the world, I ſhall carry nothing our; if I have Food and Rayment, and things convenient for me while I am in the world, what ſhould I trouble my ſelf any further, to moyl, and labour, and keep a do for I know not what? <hi>We brought nothing into the world, and 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> men dont think it certain that they ſhall car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry nothing out of the world; but 'tis certain, you
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:94121:150"/>may build upon it, that you ſhall carry nothing out of the world: Well, let us be content then with a little of the world.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, This ſerves for reproof, to reprove moſt men and women, Profeſſors, Chriſtians, thoſe that are look'd upon as Godly, and in the ſtate of grace; 'tis a reproof unto them, that they love the world, and the things of the world; I might bitterly, and ſharply reprove men and women, and profeſſors upon this account.</p>
            <p>But I know what will be ſaid preſently, we dont <hi>love</hi> the world, we do but <hi>uſe</hi> the world.</p>
            <p>I ſhould be glad it would prove ſo, let us come to the teſt then and try it out, whether we do love the world, yea, or no; and I ſhall deſire you to put ſome queſtions to your own hearts, to deal impartially with them; for you ſee what is ſaid, <hi>Love not</hi> the world not the things of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> Firſt, put this queſtion unto your ſouls, am I not more careful, and take greater pains, and am at greater coſts for the things of the world then I am for my ſoul, and the things of my ſoul; then I am for heaven, and the things of heaven, ſpiritual things; how careful are men and women? and what coſts and pains will they be at for houſes &amp; Land, &amp; Purchaſes, &amp; good Bargains? what a deal of pains do men take about theſe things, if there be a crack in a title of Land, or of a Houſe, what pains will they take to cleer up things, to get things made ſure? If there be a ſtorm at Sea, that Ships be in danger, what inſuring is there? Men will take pains, and be at coſt to inſure the ſame; but now as for their ſouls and eternal conditions, what little pains do men take? and what little
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:94121:151"/>coſt will they be at that way? whereas the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſaith, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.12. <hi>Work out your own Salvation with fear and trembling;</hi> you are in a ſtorm, and your ſalvations are in danger, you may loſe your ſouls; work out your ſalvations with fear and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling: Work them out of the dark, work them out of the doubts, and fears; and all diſputes, work them out againſt all objections, and get things cleer'd up, work out your ſalvations with fear and trembling; 'tis a hard work, a difficult work to accompliſh and bring about, and there need be great pains taken about it, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. Give diligence to make your calling and election ſure, there muſt be diligence; give diligence to it, ſaith he, it calls for it, it is not eaſily done, 'tis not ſaying, A Lord have mercy upon me will ſave a man, or aſſure a man; No, there muſt be praying, and ſtrugling, and crying, and wreſtling with God, ſearching of Scriptures, and applying of truths home to a mans own heart; and <hi>v.</hi> 5. <hi>Giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue,</hi> &amp;c. men and women ſhould be diligent, and very di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, and all their diligence ſhould run out that way, to get grace, and to make their callings and elections ſure: Now we give all diligence in other things, and little pains is taken about the ſoul; what doth this argue then, but that I love thy world, and the things of the world, my love <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

<pb n="295" facs="tcp:94121:151"/>In the 14. <hi>Luke,</hi> when they were called to the great feaſt, they all made their excuſes; ſaith one, I have bought a yoke of Oxen, and I muſt go try them; I have bought a Farm, and I muſt go ſee that; I have married a Wife, and I cannot come; they could not come to hear Chriſt, nor partake of the great things that Chriſt tendred unto them in the Goſpel; they joſſel'd out theſe things: So the things of the world, do joſſel our prayer, the reading of the world, inſtructing of their family meditating, and the examining of their hearts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and if they do not joſſel them out, yet they do cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail them, and they are ſhortened, and leſſened; do you in the firſt place ſeek the Kingdom of God, and the righteouſneſs thereof; No, the things of the world it's to be fear'd do joſſel out the things of the Kingdom of heaven, the things of God, and of the Soul, and this is an argument that we love the world, when better things, and things of greater weight and concernment are ſet aſide for petty and mean things in compariſon; ſome flight buſineſs do make a man neglect holy duties, or poſt them over in a formal way, whereas <hi>David</hi> who was a man after Gods own heart, a gracious man, in the 119. <hi>Pſal.</hi> ſaith, <hi>I thought on my wayes, and turned my feet unto thy Teſtimonies;</hi> I conſidered my wayes, the world was drawing me another way, but I conſidered my wayes, and turned my feet unto thy Teſtimonies. <hi>I made haſt and delayed not, to keep thy Commandments,</hi> and v. 62. <hi>At midnight I will riſe to give thanks unto thee: becauſe of thy righteous Judgments;</hi> I will riſe at mid-night, I will break my ſleep, I will do it in ſecret, when no eye ſees me, none privy to it

In the 1. <hi>Prov.</hi> 19. <hi>So is every one that is greedy of gain.</hi> Men are gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of gain, men look upon thoſe that are rich in the world, and they labour to be like them, and to overtake them, to be as great, and high, and honourable as they; to have as great Purchaſes as they have; to have as great Revennues and In-comes as they have; but they look not at
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:94121:152"/>thoſe that are rich in grace, thoſe that are very ſpiritual, and heavenly, and Godly, and walk cloſe with God, and ſay, I would I were like to them, and ſo labour to get more grace, and to walk with God, as <hi>Enoch</hi> did for three hundred years together; now when it is thus, it's an argument men love the world: Ask your own hearts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whether it be ſo or no with you, that you are deſirous of more and more of the world, but are not deſirous after more and more of heaven, and of God, and covetous after the beſt things.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Ask your hearts what they do find moſt ſweet and content in; is it not in the world, and the things of the world? how ſweet and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing are they unto our natures? but for the things of heaven, what are they? what are the things of heaven unto you? they are like the white of an Egg, they are unſavory things to men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, or very little ſavour in them: <hi>There be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that ſay, who will ſhew us any good?</hi> who will ſhew us a good bargain? who will ſhew us a good purchaſe? who will ſhew us any good? But <hi>Lord</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) do thou lift up the light of thy counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance upon me:</hi> There was good in that, that was ſweet unto him, the light of Gods countenance, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.8. <hi>Taſte and ſee, that the Lord is good;</hi> the Lord is good, and the Lord is ſweet to my ſoul, and he would have others taſte how good the Lord is: to have the favour of God, commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God, peace with God, joy in the Holy Ghoſt, oh, theſe have a ſweet taſte and reliſh to a gracious heart and ſoul! Others ſay, who will ſhew us any good, Corn, and Wine, and Oyl, Pleaſures, and Profits, and the like? theſe are
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:94121:153"/>pleaſing to them, and as for ſpiritual and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things they are notions, and ſhaddows, and they make ſmall account of them: but a gracious ſoul he finds it as in the 19. <hi>Pſal. The Statutes of the Lord are right,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, Rejoycing the heart;</hi> his Crown and Kingdom did not ſo rejoyce his heart as God's Statutes did, and <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>More are they to be deſired than Gold, yea, than much fine Gold; ſweeter alſo than Honey, and the Honey-comb.</hi> Give me Gold (ſay ſome) Gold, Gold; but ſaith <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> the Statutes of God they are more deſirable than fine Gold, the choiceſt Gold, they are ſweeter than Honey, and the Honey-comb. Honey is ſweet, but the Honey-comb, the Honey that runs out of it ſelf out of the Honey-comb, that's ſweeteſt of all; now ſaith he, they are ſweeter than Honey, and the Honey-comb. Now what ſweetneſs do your ſouls find in theſe things? In the 3. <hi>Mal.</hi> 14. <hi>What profit is it (ſay they) that we have walked mournfully before the Lord of Hoſts;</hi> we find no profit in this ſerving of God, and in being, much in prayer, and reading, and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and holy conference, in hearing, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping of God. We find no profit in it, what profit is it? To ſuch men, Gain is Godlineſs; but to a gracious heart, any thing of God is ſweet, and great gain.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> Fifthly, put this queſtion to your hearts, heart, doſt thou not uſe queſtionable, and unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful means to get the world, and neglect lawful means, and unqueſtionable means that would get heaven, and get ſpiritual things? Many do uſe things queſtionable, and means queſtionable, and unlawful too, to get the world; you have it
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:94121:153"/>in the 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4.6. <hi>That no man go beyond, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> defraud his Brother in any matter, becauſe that the Lord is the avenger of all ſuch;</hi> dont men go beyond others, and defraud others to get the world, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, or over-reach them as the word ſignifies, they have a deep inſight into things, and they will over-reach a man that's ſimple, and labour to wring from them, and draw from them, that ſo they may encreaſe their eſtates; theſe love the world: ſo in the 8. <hi>Amos</hi> 5. ſaith he, <hi>They do fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſifie the ballances by deceit;</hi> when men do falſifie the haſlances, have falſe weights, falſe wayes, falſe lights, it's an argument they love the world, and the things of the world, that will hazzard their ſouls to get the world, and grate upon their own Conſciences; for if ever their Conſciences be awakened, they will ſpeak, and accuſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn for ſuch practices. This is a manifeſt argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of loving the world; if we can uſe queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable means, and unlawful means, and then neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the means that are unqueſtionable, and very lawful: God hath appointed means to get Grace, Prayer, Meditating, hearing the Word, &amp; ſearching the Scriptures; theſe are means that are unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable, and will bring in gain, whereas the other are queſtionable, and unlawful means.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> Sixthly, put this queſtion to your ſouls; Soul, doſt thou not affect notions, and learning, and wiſdom of words, and parts, and gifts, and things of this nature? All theſe things are of the world, and how are mens fancies tickled with theſe, and affected and taken with theſe? Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Learning, Fathers, and Latine, Greek, Hebrew, and Authors, how it pleaſes ſome men,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:94121:154"/>which ſhews they are but carnal, natural, and worldly; as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.4. <hi>My Speech, and my Preaching, was not with the enticing words of mans wiſdom, but in demonſtration of the Spirit and of power, that your faith ſhould not ſtand in the wiſdom of Men, but in the power of God.</hi> The faith of ſuch men ſtands in the wiſdom of men; he is a brave Orator, he is a Learned man, and he hath ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar notions and expreſſions, and theſe things pleaſe them, and ſo they have a faith that ſtands in the wiſdom of men; but now as for the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of the Goſpel, and plain wholſom truths, theſe are hardly welcome to them. Now that which is of God is plain, and ſpiritual, and the more ſpiritual any truth is, the more welcome to a gracious heart; but the more ſpiritual it is, the leſs acceptable to that man whoſe heart loves the world, becauſe it ſtrikes at his carnalneſs, and his corruptions: So that ask your hearts that que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> Seventhly, Laſtly, put this queſtion to your hearts, whether thou art not more griev'd and troubled for the loſs of outward things, worldly things, then thou art for the loſs of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual things, or the removal of ſpiritual things; many mourn bitterly for Relations, Husband taken away, a Wife taken away, Children taken away, Eſtate taken away; how they mourn, and weep, and hang down their heads, and forſake their dyet, and take to their Chambers, and Beds, and will not be comforted many times: But if a Godly Miniſter be taken away, Ordinances ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, Sabbath taken away, Meetings taken away, theſe things dont much trouble them: Now
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:94121:154"/>it's an argument that we love the world when we can be affected ſo, with the loſs of theſe things that we know we muſt part with, and the loſs of other things concerning our ſouls, and which we ſhould mind above all things in the world, the Word of God, and his Sabbath, and Ordinances, and Worſhip, and the like; theſe little trouble us: Well, by theſe things you may know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you love the world, yea, or no; and if it be ſo, you are worthy of great blame for loving of the world.</p>
            <p>In the next place, it ſhall be a uſe of exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to exhort you not to love the world, nor the things of the world, the pomp of the world, tho pleaſures of the world, the profits, preferments, and honours of the world, and the things that are in it, Love them not.</p>
            <p>I ſhall do two things here;</p>
            <p>Firſt, Give you ſeveral grounds or arguments to enforce the exhortation. Secondly, Some di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections how to take off our hearts from loving the world.</p>
            <p>Firſt, We ſhould not love the world, becauſe it is a ſin to love the world; whatever is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den us is a ſin, and will you live in ſin? is ſin a ſmall matter? ſin is the tranſgreſſion of a Law; you will ſay, well, here's the Law, <hi>Love not the world.</hi> If you love the world, you tranſgreſs this Law; therefore dont live in the tranſgreſſion of this Law: It's an ill thing to live in ſin, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.4. <hi>The ſoul that ſins ſhall dye,</hi> be it what ſoul it will; the ſouls of the higheſt, or loweſt, learned or ignorant, rich or poor, if they live in ſin they ſhall dye; it's a dangerous thing to live
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:94121:155"/>in ſin, a pleaſing ſin, a profitable ſin, an honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſin, if you love the world you live in ſin, and we ſhould as in the 12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. abhor that which is evil, and love that which is good; ſin is evil, the leaſt ſin is evil, ſinful thoughts, ſinful luſts are evil, if unconſented to it's evil, much more if conſented to, and lived in, and practiſed; it will bring forth death, death eternal, for the wages of ſin is death; that's the firſt reaſon.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We ſhould not love the world, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the command of the great God, the great, and bleſſed, and glorious God, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us to not to love the world, <hi>Love not the world,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>nor the things that are in it,</hi> ſhall not the command of the great God obtain upon us, and prevail with us? <hi>In the word of a King there is power,</hi> here's the word of the greateſt King of all Kings, the great God of Heaven and Earth, <hi>Love not the world,</hi> ſaith God; ſaith <hi>Peter,</hi> Lord, we have been toyling all the night and caught no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, nevertheleſs at thy command I will throw out the Net: So the command of God, we ſhould hearken to it; at thy command Lord, I will not love the world, nor the things of the world. In the 35. <hi>Jer.</hi> 6. There are the <hi>Rechabites,</hi> their Father commanded them to drink no Wine, to plant no Vineyards, to build no Houſes, and one comes to them and ſets Wine before them, and fills Cups, and ſaith unto them, drink Wine; ſay they, <hi>v.</hi> 6. we will drink no Wine, for <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadab</hi> the Son of <hi>Rechab</hi> our Father commanded us, ſaying, ye ſhall drink no Wine, neither ye, nor your ſons for ever, neither ſhall ye build Houſe, nor ſow Seed, nor plant Vineyard; now ſee in
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:94121:155"/>the 14. <hi>v.</hi> what the Lord ſaith, <hi>The words of</hi> Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dab <hi>the Son of</hi> Rechab, <hi>that he commanded his Sons, not to drink Wine, are performed.</hi> Here's dutiful Sons, obſerve the command of their Father, they will drink no Wine, build no Houſe, ſow no Seed; <hi>They are performed, for unto this day, they drink none, but obey their Fathers Commandment: Notwithſtanding I have ſpoken unto you, riſing early, and ſpeaking, but ye hearkned not unto me,</hi> ſaith God; what a reproach is this to me faith God, that the command of a man is obſerved, and obeyed; and the command of me the great God, that have your lives and all in my hand is not obſerved, not regarded; well, the great God, he faith unto us, <hi>Love not the world.</hi> Therefore let his commands be of force and authority with us, to knock our hearts off from the love of the world.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Love not the world nor the things of it, becauſe it is the portion of the wicked, of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly men, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17.14. <hi>From men which are thy hand, O Lord, from men of the world, which have their portion in this life,</hi> There are men of the world, Inhabitants of the world, they are of the world, of worldly principles, of worldly affections, and of worldly practices and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, they have their portion in this life, ſaith he, the things of this world are their portion: would you have your portion here? have your portion in theſe things, it's a poor portion, a periſhing portion, an unſatisfying portion, the worſt portion of all. In the 21. <hi>Job.</hi> 7, 8, 9. <hi>Wherefore do the wicked live?</hi> ſaith <hi>Job;</hi> Lord, wherefore doth the wicked live? wicked men are not worthy to live in the world; wherefore do
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:94121:156"/>the wicked live, <hi>become old, you are mighty in power.</hi> To live, and live long, and be mighty in power, and place, and honour, and eſtates; they are mighty in power, <hi>Their ſeed is eſtabliſhed in their ſight with them, and their off-ſpring before their eyes.</hi> They have their ſeed, and poſterity, and are eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed: <hi>Their houſes are ſafe from fear, neither is the rod of God upon them; Their Bull gendreth and faileth not, their Cow calveth, and caſteth not her Calf; they ſend forth their little ones like a Flock, and their Children dance. They take the Timbrel and Harp, and Rejoyce at the ſound of the Organ: They ſpend their dayes in wealth, and in a moment go down to the Grave.</hi> Here are wicked men now; you ſee it's their portion to have the world, to have the muſick, and mirth, and all things according to their hearts deſires; it's their portion, and who would have ſuch a portion? It was the trouble of <hi>Jer.</hi> 12.1. <hi>Wherefore doth the wicked proſper? wherefore are all they happy that deal very treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly?</hi> wicked men proſper in the world; though they deal treacherouſly, yet they proſper; and ſaith he, <hi>Thou haſt planted them, yea, they have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken root: They grow, yea, they bring forth fruit; Thou art near in their mouth, and far from their Reins.</hi> The world is the portion of wicked men, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſhould not love it. <hi>Alexander,</hi> a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, he had all the world, he had it for his portion. So <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> he had the Roman Empire for his portion. <hi>Ahaſhuerus</hi> had 127 Provinces for his portion. The world is meat for Dogs, as the Apoſtle calls it <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: 'Tis a portion fit for Dogs, and 'tis not Childrens meat; therefore we ſhould not love the world, it is the portion of the wicked.</p>
            <pb n="305" facs="tcp:94121:156"/>
            <p> Fourthly, We ſhould not love the world, becauſe if we do, we ſhall meet with great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointments, much trouble, and little good in it. Great afflictions we ſhall have in the world, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. laſt. <hi>In the world ye ſhall have tribulation,</hi> ſaith Chriſt; ye ſhall have tribulations, Thorny cares, piercing cares and ſorrows, in the world ye ſhall meet with thoſe, and from day to day, &amp; year to year, you ſhall have trouble, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 1.1, <hi>Vanity of vanities, all is vanity and vexation of Spirit;</hi> you meet with nothing but vanity and vexation of ſpirit; there is a great deal of vexation in the beſt condition the world affords unto any man: and in the 5. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> from the 11. v. to the 16. <hi>When Goods increaſe, they are increaſed that eat them:</hi> There will be many mouths if you have much wealth, to conſume the ſame. <hi>And what good is there to the owners thereof, ſaving the beholding of them with their eyes?</hi> what good have you, others eat them as well as you? you behold them, others behold them as well as you; all the difference is, theſe are mine; No, they are not yours; they are the worlds goods, not yours; yours for your uſe: well, <hi>The ſleep of a labouring man is ſweet, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he eateth little or much:</hi> A poor man that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours hard, his ſleep is ſweet unto him; <hi>but the abundance of the rich will not ſuffer him to ſleep;</hi> is not this an evil? further, <hi>There is a ſore evil which I have ſeen under the Sun, namely, Riches kept from the owners thereof to their hurt.</hi> They get riches, and treaſure up riches, and keep them unto their hurt; how to their hurt? why they are hurt with their fears, hurt with their cares, and they are hurt with abuſing of them, and they keep them to their hurt;
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:94121:157"/>others get them from them, ſometimes the fire, ſometimes Thieves, ſometimes Oppreſſors come and take them away. They are kept to their hurt, and men lye in wait to make a prey of them and theirs: <hi>But</hi> ſaith he, <hi>thoſe riches periſh by evil tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel:</hi> ſome miſcarriage of a man makes him loſe his eſtate; a word, or an act ſometimes makes him loſe his eſtate: <hi>And he begetteth a Son, and there is nothing in his hand,</hi> there is nothing in his hand to do any good, to improve this that's left unto him. <hi>As he came forth of his Mothers womb, naked ſhall he return to go as he came, and ſhall take nothing of his labour, which he may carry away in his hand:</hi> He ſhall carry away nothing of all he takes ſuch a deal of pains and trouble about; <hi>and this alſo is a ſore evil, that in all points as he came, ſo ſhall he go;</hi> This is a ſore evil, and yet men do encreaſe this evil to themſelves daily; ſo that men will meet with diſappointments, and meet with trouble and vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if they love the world, and things of the world; therefore we ſhould not love it.</p>
            <p>Fiſthly, (To beat us off from the love of the world) the love of the world hath been the ruine of Millions; hardly any man periſhes but it is upon the account of the world, and the things of the world, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.19. <hi>Whoſe end is deſtruction,</hi> whoſe God is their belly, whoſe glory is in their ſhame, <hi>who mind earthly things;</hi> when men do mind earthly things, and love the world, and the things of it, their end is deſtruction, their God is their belly, their glory is in their ſhame; they are rich, and they muſt go ſo and ſo; they muſt have their pleaſures, and they muſt exceed; they glory in their ſhame, in Drunkenneſs, in Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:94121:157"/>in Oppreſſion; they glory in their ſhame, they mind earthly things, their end is deſtruction; honours, pleaſure, profit, power, do poiſon the ſouls of men, and are the ruine of them, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.9. <hi>They that will be rich, fall into Temptation, and a ſnare, and into many fooliſh and hurtful luſts, which drown men in deſtruction and perdition;</hi> men love the world and the things of it, and they will be rich, and ſo fall into temptation, and a ſnare, and into many fooliſh and hurtful luſts, which drown men in deſtruction and perdition: Ill gotten goods, that drown a man in deſtruction and perdition; and the Lord Chriſt tells you, <hi>It is eaſier for a Camel</hi> or a Cable, <hi>to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> It's a hard thing for a man to be rich and to be good, to be rich and to be ſav'd: One at Sea having made a great voyage, and coming near home, the Ship leak'd and was ready to ſink, he fills his Pockets and Boſome with choice things, Silver, Gold, and Jewels, and going out of it to the Boat, through weight of the thick clay he had laded himſelf with, let go his hold and dropt into the Sea, and was ſeen no more: So many, through the fulneſs &amp; weight of their riches, miſs the Boat ſhould carry them to Heaven, &amp; are ſunk down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Sea of miſery, if not into eternal miſery. And another I have read of, giving away his eſtate, one ask'd him why he did ſo? that I may go the more eaſily up <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Ladder, ſaith he. The ruine of moſt men and women, is the world, and the love of the world, ſomething or other in it they affect and dote upon, that ruines their ſouls to all eternity; therefore we ſhould take heed
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:94121:158"/>of that which ruines ſo many, and not affect the ſame.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, If we love the world, God will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitter it unto us one way or other; <hi>Jonas</hi> affects his Gourd, and was much taken with his Gourd; God ſends a worm in the night, and that gnaws the root of it, and the Gourd withers away, and <hi>Jonas</hi> was perplext and angry with God for taking away his Gourd: <hi>Jacob,</hi> he loves <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and he loves <hi>Benjamin,</hi> and being taken from him, the old man he thought that with ſorrow he ſhould go down to his grave; God did imbitter thoſe things unto him his heart was upon. Many men love pleaſures, and credit, and honour, and God whips them ſooner or later, for the love of thoſe things ſome croſs or other will befall them. Many love their Children, and God takes them away and then they are in bitterneſs, and mourn as for an <hi>onely Son.</hi> Many they have beauty, and God ſends the Small Pox and takes away their beauty, and imbitters them: Children which their Parents have made Idols of, how untoward have they proved? uſually they prove matter of ſorrow and ſhame unto them, and increaſe and multiply their fears and cares, and tears; they are multiplyed, becauſe they did dote upon them, and loved them inordinately. 'Tis ſo uſually with the things of this world, if we love them, God will croſs us in them; the way to enjoy any mercy is to love it but a little, or to love it in order to God.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, We ſhould not love the world, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we cannot enjoy the world long, we cannot have the things of it long; it may be they will leave us, however we muſt leave them, and the
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:94121:158"/>ſtronger affections we have to any thing, the more bitter will the affliction be when we leave it, ſtrong affections bring great afflictions unto men and women; in the 12. <hi>Luke</hi> 20. ſee how ſhort a mans time is, the fool there in the Goſpel had got a great eſtate, thou haſt much goods laid up for many years, take thine eaſe, eat, drink, and be merry; but God ſaid unto him, Thou fool, <hi>This night</hi> thy ſoul ſhall be required of thee, then whoſe ſhall thoſe things be which thou haſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided? we have many ſuch fools in the world, that lay up much here, and think they ſhall live long, and be at eaſe, as many uſe to ſay, well, when I have gotten ſuch an eſtate, then I will give over the Sea, and live at eaſe; but before that comes, Thou fool, <hi>This night;</hi> thou art taken away from it in the midſt of thy purſuit of it, ſo that we cannot long enjoy the things of this world; and therefore ſeeing <hi>the time is ſhort,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith, uſe the world as not abuſing it: uſe the world you may, but dont love it, for then you abuſe it; uſe the world for your neceſſity, to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther your journey to Heaven, to further your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts before God, but dont abuſe it, dont love it; The time is ſhort.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, To take our hearts off from the world, conſider, that thoſe are truely Godly, they are for God, and not for the world, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.3. <hi>Know that the Lord hath ſet apart him that is Godly for himſelf.</hi> God hath ſet a Godly man apart from the world, and ſet him for himſelf; now if thou beeſt ſet apart for God, wilt thou give thy ſelf to the world? Be for him who hath ſet thee apart for himſelf: A maid when ſhe is ſet a part by friends for ſuch
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:94121:159"/>a man, ſhe will be for him, and not for another; ſo when God hath ſet you apart from the world, your hearts will be for God, and not for the world, and it's an argument that a man is a Godly man when he is ſet apart: God calls them out of the world, and chooſes them for himſelf, and he will have them to be imployed in his way, and his work, and not for the world. A Godly man is above the world, and better than the world; and what, ſhould he looſe himſelf in the world, and mire himſelf with the world, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. of whom the world was not worthy, the world did not think them worthy to live in it, and the world was not worthy of them; ſo precious is a Godly man: the ſoul is a precious thing, and more precious than all the world, but when there's precious grace in the ſoul, it's far beyond the worth of worlds, a thouſand worlds are not worthy one gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſoul; therefore be not for the world, but for God, for whom thou art ſet apart.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, We ſhould not love the world, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch as do love the world, they dont love the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.18, 19. <hi>Many walk</hi> ſaith he, <hi>of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the Croſs of Chriſt:</hi> Mark, they are not friends to Chriſt nor to his Croſs; they are <hi>enemies</hi> to the Croſs of Chriſt; and who be they? he tells you in the 19 v. <hi>who mind earthly things.</hi> Men that mind earthly things, the things of this world, are enemies to the Croſs of Chriſt; and <hi>James</hi> 4.4. ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Ye Adnlterers, and Adultereſſes, know ye not that the friendſhip of the world is enmity with God? whoſoever therefore will be a friend of the
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:94121:159"/>world, is the enemy of God.</hi> To be an enemy of God, and an enemy to Chriſt, is a ſad thing, not to love the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.22. <hi>If any man love not the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, let him be Anathema Maranatha:</hi> Let him be accurſed till I come, ſaith the Lord Jeſus, I will come e're long again to ſee who loves me, and who loves me not; now if any man dont love me, let him be accurſed till I come and ſend him to hell, and give him his portion there: well then, this ſhould prevail with us not to love the world; for we cannot love Chriſt if we love the world, no man can ſerve two Maſters, we cannot love God and Mammon.</p>
            <p>Tenthly, Laſtly, we ſhould not love the world, 'tis not the end of our creation, nor the end of our redemption, but croſſes the end of both: why was man created? man was created for God, and for communion with God; he was made after Gods own Image, in knowledge, and righteouſneſs, and holineſs, that ſo he might be a meet companion (if I may ſo ſpeak) for God to converſe with, and to have familiarity with. Now if we love the world, what Communion have we with God? how do we anſwer the end of our creation? In <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.4. he tells them that they are redeemed from the earth, and from among men, it croſſes the end of our redemption. The end of our <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is to have Communion with God, to ſerve God, and to walk with God; and the end of our <hi>Redemption</hi> is, that we ſhould follow the Lamb, and being redeemed, ſerve in holineſs and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs all the dayes of our lives. Now loving the world is croſs to both theſe; if we love the world, we will follow the world; if we love
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:94121:160"/>Chriſt, we will follow him: So that if you would not croſs the end of your creation, nor the end of your redemption, dont love the world nor the things of the world. By this time I conceive you are convinced in your Judgments you ſhould not love the world.</p>
            <p>But here's the buſineſs, we would not love the world; but we find it ſuch a hard thing that we know not how to get our hearts off from the world, and the things of the world: therefore what ſhould we do in this caſe?</p>
            <p>Firſt, If you would have your affections and hearts off from the world, look well to your Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and dont highly eſteem the world; for the affections do follow the judgment, and the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions. If men have ſtrong apprehenſions of things, they will have ſtrong affections, and when men do highly eſteem of things, then their hearts are carried out ſtrongly after thoſe things, and work violently towards them. Now then, have low thoughts of the world, judge of the world as the Scripture judges of it; and how doth the Scripture judge of the world? look into the 1. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. who hath delivered us from this preſent <hi>evil world:</hi> 'Tis an evil world, a world that is full of evils, full of ſins, full of miſchief, full of oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, full of corruption, ſubject to bondage, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to periſhing, an evil world, full of evil plots, and deſigns, and devils: Thus the Scripture judges of it, do you judge of it ſo? So in the 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.19. <hi>The whole world lyes in wickedneſs,</hi> Judge you ſo of it, here's a world lyes in wickedneſs, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> lyes in the devil, and he makes uſe of the world to deceive you, and undo you, and to draw you
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:94121:160"/>to perdition. Should a man love <hi>Sodom,</hi> that lay in wickedneſs? the world is a <hi>Sodom</hi> that lyes in wickedneſs; <hi>Solomon</hi> tells you, <hi>'Tis vanity, and vexation of Spirit;</hi> and will you love <hi>vanity,</hi> and <hi>vexation of Spirit?</hi> and in the next verſe to the Text, ſaith he, <hi>All that is in the world, is the luſt of the fleſh, the luſt of the eyes, and the pride of life; and theſe are not of the Father, but of the world:</hi> All theſe ſtrengthen our luſts, and the more our luſts are ſtrengthened the more grace is hindered, and the worle we grow; but let not the painted bravery of the world deceive and cheat you; what is there in an eſtite, in power, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> men have ſtrange appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of theſe things, but ſee what <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>The faſhion of this world paſſeth away;</hi> it's all a ſhew, a Scheme, there's no ſubſtance in it. That men have low thoughts of, that they never dote upon: If a woman have low thoughts of a man, ſhe will never love him; the lower thoughts you have, the looſer will your love be; what's this world, e're long it will be turned to aſhes, and will you love aſhes; <hi>Ephraim</hi> feeds upon aſhes, and upon the wind, vain things, vain worſhip, and traditions, and inventions of men, and things of this nature; men and women feed upon aſhes, poor low things: well, judge lowly of the world, and account not highly of the world, nor any thing in the world; for it's a world that lyes in wickedneſs, a world that is evil: The more you do ponder upon theſe things, the more will your hearts be taken off.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If you would not love the world, take pains with your own hearts, &amp; mortifie your luſts; mortifie the luſts that are in your hearts, 'tis our luſts make us love the world; 'tis from the
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:94121:161"/>wiſdom of the fleſh that men do love the world, and the things of the world; in <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.4. <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour not to be Rich;</hi> why, <hi>ceaſe from thine own wiſdom:</hi> ſaith he, 'tis thine own wiſdom, 'tis but the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of thy fleſh, and of thy corrupt nature that thou wouldeſt be rich: Labour not to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> rich, ceaſe from thine own wiſdom, and <hi>the wiſdom of the fleſh is enmity to God.</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Now in the 13 v. <hi>If ye live after the fleſh ye ſhall dye; but if ye through the Spirit do mortifie the deeds of the body, ye ſhall live.</hi> Mortifie theſe Iuſts, our luſts are deceitful things, unruly things, they are craving things, and they have their pretences: Do but hearken to me in this one thing, and if you would but hearken to me now, I will trouble you no more; but if you do, they will come again and again, and never have done; therefore the beſt way for us is to mortifie our luſts, and if we would do ſo, we ſhould not love the world. <hi>From whence come wars and fightings among you, come they not hence, even of your luſts, that war in your members; ye luſt, and have not, ye kill, and deſire to have, and cannot obtain, ye fight and war, yet ye have not, becauſe ye ask not; ye ask and receive not, becauſe ye ask amiſs, that you may conſume it upon your luſts.</hi> Your luſts will ſet a praying to have the world, to have honour, and power, and riches, and you have them not; but now, if our luſts were mortified, all theſe things would be at an end preſently; but we ſeek to gratifie our laſts, and they undo us.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, If we would not love the world, nor the things of the world, then let us look much at the other world, there is another world, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.5. <hi>For unto the Angels hath he not put in ſubjection the
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:94121:161"/>world to come.</hi> There is a world to come, and that world's a better world than this world, for in the 11 ch. 16 v. But now they deſire a <hi>better</hi> countrey, that is an heavenly. <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and the Prophets, they look'd at a better coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey; there's a better world above, better things above then are here in this world. And if ſo be we would look at that world, the glory of it, the riches of it, the pleaſures of it, the company of it, the latitude of it, we ſhould ſoon bid farewel to this world, and look upon it as a dream, a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, a picture, as nothing, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. laſt, <hi>While we look not at things which are ſeen, but at things which are not ſeen, for the things which are ſeen are temporal, but the things which are not ſeen are eternal.</hi> There are things not ſeen, eternal things, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal riches, the eternal God, the Lord Jeſus, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Angels, the Saints at one, Rivers of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure at the right hand of God: look at theſe things, and then your hearts will be taken off of this world.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, If we would get our hearts off from the world, which is a thing very neceſſary, then keep your hearts with all diligence; look as nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly to thy heart as to thy eyes, to the meat thou eateſt, to thy life; keep it with <hi>all diligence,</hi> look to your affections, and let them not rove and wander up and down in the world, and range here and there; look to your <hi>fear,</hi> many are afraid of poverty, and afraid they ſhall not have to live, and pay every man his own, and ſo are filled with fears that they ſhall want; but <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.26. ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Take no thought for your life, what ye ſhall eat, or what ye ſhall drink, nor yet for your body,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:94121:162"/>what ye ſhall put on, is not the life more than meat, and the body than rayment? Behold the fowls of the air, for they ſow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns, yet your heavenly father feedeth them, are ye not much better than they;</hi> poor creatures dont fear, ſaith he, dont fear want, and poverty, and that ye ſhall not have meat, and drink, and cloaths; the fowls of the air are never afraid, they have no body to look after them: you feed your tame fowls indeed, but who provides for the wild-fowls? God provides for them: look well to your fear now, that makes men love the world, and ſcrape, and rave, that they might have meat, and drink, and clothes: So look well to your love, that you take complacency in no creature whatſoever; but love the Lord, take complacency in God, and Chriſt: you know what Chriſt ſaith, Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with <hi>all</hi> thy heart, with <hi>all</hi> thy ſoul, with <hi>all</hi> thy ſtrength, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now if God have <hi>all,</hi> what ſhall the creature have? But the creatures have all, and God hath little or nothing; here's a great failing, yet here's all put four times, with <hi>all</hi> thy ſoul, with <hi>all</hi> thy ſtrength, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> God ſhould have all, and the creatures have little or none. So look well to your <hi>deſires,</hi> men are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring, O that I had this or that; but thou ſhalt not covet, ſaith God; be content with what thou haſt: we ſhould not covet any thing of the world, but follow our callings, and leave events to God; if God will caſt it in, take it thankfully, and uſe it well to his glory.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, If you would not love the world, get your wills ſubordinate to Gods will. God is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely wiſe, and infinitely good, he is the great
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:94121:162"/>Soveraign, and his will is not to be diſputed, Gods will muſt take place: now what is the will of God, labour not to be rich, ceaſe from thine own wiſdom, here's the will of God: now if our wills were ſubordinate to his will, there would be no loving of the world; little or much of the world, it's all one to me, it's the will of God that I look after, and if God will give me any thing, or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, I am content therewith.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, If you would have your hearts taken off from the love of the world, and the things of it; behold, and look upon the Lord Jeſus Chriſt crucified, and glorified. Set Chriſt crucified of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten before your eyes, and look upon him by an eye of faith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.14. <hi>God forbid,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, that I ſhould glory,</hi> ſave in the croſs of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by whom the world is crucified un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, and I unto the world; I look upon Chriſt crucified, and I by an eye of faith can ſee Chriſt hanging there, and all the glory of the world ſtain'd there: Is all the world comparable to Chriſt? here's the King, the High-Prieſt, the Mediator, the great Prophet; here's the Heir of the world crucified, here's his blood running down, and he hath lay'd down his life for ſinners, and to take off my heart from the world; if you look but upon a dead man, it ſtrikes a damp into you; what will the looking upon Chriſt do then? it will ſtrike a damp in your hearts towards the world, if you look upon Jeſus Chriſt crucified, <hi>I am crucified to the world,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul:</hi> So look upon Chriſt glorified, and our hearts will be raiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the world. <hi>Col.</hi> 3. <hi>If ye then be riſen with Chriſt, ſeek thoſe things which are above, where Chriſt
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:94121:163"/>ſitteth on the right hand of God. Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.</hi> Chriſt hath dyed, and is riſen again, and gone to glory; if now you be riſen out of the ſtate of ſin, tranſlated out of the power of darkneſs into the Kingdom of his dear Son, you will have your hearts where Chriſt is: conſider Chriſt, there's my <hi>Head,</hi> my <hi>King,</hi> my <hi>Husband,</hi> there's my <hi>Redeemer,</hi> there's he that is a thouſand times better than the world; therefore I will not ſet my heart upon the things of the earth, but upon the things above: what a glorious thing it is to ſee the King in his glory? look much, and conſider much of Chriſt crucified, and Chriſt glorified.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, Laſtly, if we would have our hearts taken off from the world, ſee you love God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf more, that bleſſed God more and more, and that will eſtrange your hearts from the creature, and from the world; for you will find all in the creature united in God, and infinitely more than in the world, than in the creature; if a man be in love with a Blackamore, it may be ſhe hath a good feature, but ſhe is black; bring a beautiful and lovely object now, and it will take him off from the black: the world is but a Blackamore, an evil thing, and it's full of corruption, having eſcaped the <hi>corruption</hi> that is in the world through luſts: the world is corrupted through luſts, and is full of loathſomneſs; but look upon the beauties of God, and the excellencies of God are ſuch as would raviſh a mans ſoul, and draw it up unto him.</p>
            <p>And to cloſe all, mark in the Text, Love not the world, neither things that are in the world. If
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:94121:163"/>any man love the world, <hi>The love of the Father is not in him.</hi> If you love the world, the love of the father is not in you, the father doth not love you (take it that way) if you love the world; or you may take it the other way, you dont love the father if you love the world. If you would therefore have an evidence that the father loves you, and you love the father, love not the world; but let your love be more and more to the father, and ſo you will have more and more evidence of his love, and that you dont love the world. Thus you ſee many Arguments to beat us off, and the remedies, and helps how to get us off from the love of the world; which the Lord make effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual.</p>
